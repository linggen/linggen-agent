//! Mid-session self-review nudge.

//! Built-in core memory (identity + style) lives in `core_memory.rs`.
//! Skill memory (facts, activity, semantic retrieval) is dispatched
//! through `capability_tools::dispatch` after being registered from the
//! memory skill's `SKILL.md` `tools:` block — there is no memory-specific
//! dispatch code in the engine anymore.
//!
//! What lives here: the periodic nudge that asks the model whether the
//! recent exchange produced anything worth saving.

         user can supply? Or did the user contradict something already \
         in memory? If yes, act now: universals about the person → \
         Edit `~/.linggen/memory/identity.md` or `style.md` (tiny, \

         learning → `Memory_write({verb: \"add\", ...})` when a memory \
         provider is installed. Append, don't overwrite — if a row \
         contradicts a new fact, add the new one and let live retrieval \
         reconcile next time. **Do NOT write to project files** \
         (`<project>/AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, source, docs); those are \
         user-curated. Project-internal implementation detail is not \
         memory — drop it; the agent reads the source next time. If \

         continue with the user's current request."
