You have sent the same response multiple times in a row, which means you are stuck in a loop. This usually happens when you are waiting for something to change, but nothing will change unless you take a different action.

To break out of this loop, try one of these strategies:
- Use a different tool to gather more information (e.g., Read a related file, Grep for a different pattern).
- Rethink your approach — the current strategy is not working. Step back and consider what might be going wrong.
- If you believe the task is actually complete, emit a done action with a summary.
- If you are blocked and need user input, use AskUser to request clarification.

Do NOT repeat the same response again.
