Your plan has been recorded, but a plan alone does not make progress on the task. You MUST now emit tool calls to actually execute the work described in your plan.

Start with the first pending item — read the relevant files, then make the changes. After completing each item, update the plan status.

Do not emit another update_plan without also emitting tool calls in the same response or the following response.
