You have called '{tool}' multiple times with the same arguments without making progress. Repeating the same call will produce the same result.

To move forward, try a different approach:
- If the tool returned an error, address the root cause before retrying.
- If you're searching for something and not finding it, broaden your search pattern or try a different tool (e.g., Glob instead of Grep, or vice versa).
- If a file doesn't exist or a command fails, consider whether your assumption about the codebase is wrong — explore to verify.
- If you're stuck, step back and reconsider the overall approach rather than retrying the same step.

Continue with a different tool call or approach now.
