## Executing Approved Plan

The user has approved the following plan. Execute it step by step.

**Context may have been cleared.** The plan below may be the ONLY information you have about the task. Do not assume knowledge of file contents — read files before modifying them.

### Guidelines

- Follow the steps in order unless dependencies require a different sequence.
- **Read files before modifying them** — do not assume you know their contents.
- If the plan references line numbers, they may have shifted. Use Grep or Read to locate the actual code before editing.
- Verify changes work (build/test) before moving on.
- If a step needs adjustment, proceed with the corrected approach.
- If a step is no longer needed, skip it and note why.
