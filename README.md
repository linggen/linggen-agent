## What is Linggen?

Architecturally, Linggen is **the root system for AI agents**. The core
runtime manages agent processes, communication, and execution; everything
else (skills, agents, missions) grows on top as files. An "AI app" in
Linggen is a skill, an agent, or a mission — markdown + scripts, not code
plugins. The runtime gives every app a process, syscalls (built-in tools),
a filesystem (memory), permissions, and a network surface (P2P rooms).

Apps drop into a folder and run.

### OS analogy

| OS | Linggen |
|:---|:---|
| Process | Agentic loop — one running agent |
| Interrupt | User message queue — checked each iteration |
| Thread / Fork | Subagent delegation — concurrent child execution |
| Syscall | Tool call — built-in tools are the kernel API |
| Dynamic library | Skill — loaded at runtime, no code changes |
| Cron job | Mission — scheduled agent / app / script |
| Driver | Model provider — Ollama, Claude, GPT, Gemini, Bedrock |
| Filesystem | Memory store — core markdown + LanceDB RAG via `ling-mem` |
| Process privilege | Permission modes (chat / read / edit / admin) + path scoping |
| Network share | Rooms — share models with peers over P2P WebRTC |

## Apps built on Linggen

- **[Sys Doctor](https://linggen.dev/apps/sysdoctor)** — AI health analyst for your Mac. Disk, security, performance, dormant apps, buyer's guide. Bundled `.app` available.
- **Memory** — `ling-mem` skill. LanceDB semantic store with typed facts, embeddings, first-class forgetting. Same store reachable from Linggen, Claude Code, or any tool that can shell out.
- **Model Sharing** — Rooms. Open one and let friends use your models over P2P WebRTC. No keys for the consumer, no cloud middleman, owner controls budget and tools.
- **Architecture Guardian** — Agent + mission. Reviews code and updates dependency graphs on a schedule, flags design violations.
- **DevOps** — Mission. Monitor CI/CD, auto-fix flaky tests, manage deployments — all defined in markdown.

Skills, agents, missions — all files. New apps are a folder away. Browse community skills at [linggen.dev/skills](https://linggen.dev/skills).

## Add an app

Drop a markdown file in `~/.linggen/` — available immediately, no restart:

```markdown
---
# ~/.linggen/agents/reviewer.md
name: reviewer
description: Code review specialist.
tools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
---

You review code for bugs, style issues, and security vulnerabilities.
```

Skills (`~/.linggen/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) and missions (cron-scheduled
agent / app / script) follow the same drop-in pattern. Skills use the open
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard and work in Claude Code
and Codex too.

## Where Linggen sits

- **Local-first.** Runtime, data, and inference (when you pick local models) live on your machine. Cloud is opt-in via your own API keys.
- **Model-agnostic.** Any model — Ollama, Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter. Routing policies (`local-first`, `cloud-first`, custom) decide which model handles each request.
- **App platform, not a single product.** Coding is one app among many.
- **P2P, not centralized.** Remote access and model sharing flow over WebRTC data channels. `linggen.dev` acts as a signaling relay; it does not see chat content.
- **Skills as the contract.** Apps follow the open Agent Skills standard.

---

## Remote access

```bash
ling login   # link to linggen.dev
```

Then open `linggen.dev/app` from any browser. P2P-encrypted tunnel back to
your machine; no VPN, no port forwarding.
