Linggen is an open agent system. Add agents and skills by dropping markdown files — no code changes needed. Multiple agents, multiple models, skills, and missions, all orchestrated from one root.

## Features

- **Skills-first architecture** — add capabilities by creating a `SKILL.md` file. Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, compatible with Claude Code and Codex.
- **Multi-agent management** — create, configure, and switch between agents. Each agent has its own context, skill set, and model preference.
- **Multi-model routing** — connect local models (Ollama), OpenAI API, Claude API, or AWS Bedrock. Define routing policies like `local-first`, `cloud-first`, or custom priority rules.
- **Skills Marketplace** — search, install, and manage community skills from the built-in marketplace UI or via `/skill` chat command.
- **Mission system** — agents self-initiate work when a mission is active, or stay reactive without one.
- **Web UI + TUI** — both interfaces connect to the same backend and share session state in real-time via SSE.
- **Workspace safety** — file operations are scoped to the workspace root. Agent actions are policy-gated per agent.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://linggen.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Or build from source:

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust 1.75+, Node.js 18+
cd ui && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cargo build --release
```

### Initialize

```bash
ling init    # scaffolds ~/.linggen/ (dirs, agents, config, skills)
```

### Configure

Run `ling init` to scaffold your environment, or create `linggen.runtime.toml` manually:

```toml
[[models]]
id = "local"
provider = "ollama"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:11434"
model = "qwen3:32b"
keep_alive = "20m"

# [[models]]
# id = "cloud"
# provider = "openai"
# url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
# model = "gpt-4o"
# api_key = "sk-..."

[server]
port = 9898

[agent]
max_iters = 100
```

Config search order: `$LINGGEN_CONFIG` env var, `./linggen.runtime.toml`, `~/.config/linggen/`, `~/.local/share/linggen/`.

### Run

```bash
# Start TUI + server (default)
cargo run

# Web UI only (http://localhost:9898)
cargo run -- --web

# Dev mode (backend + Vite HMR)
cargo run -- --web --dev   # terminal 1
cd ui && npm run dev       # terminal 2
```

## Adding Agents

Drop a markdown file in `agents/` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: ling
description: General-purpose coding assistant.
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]
---

You are a coding agent. Write clean, tested code.
```

Frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `personality`.

The agent is available immediately on the next startup — no code changes needed.

## Adding Skills

Create a directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
.linggen/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md    # project-scoped
~/.linggen/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md  # global
```

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Does something useful.
allowed-tools: [Bash, Read]
---

Instructions for the agent when this skill is invoked.
```

Invoke skills via `/my-skill` in chat, or the model invokes them automatically based on context.

### Skills Marketplace

Install community skills from the [marketplace](https://github.com/linggen/skills):

- **Web UI**: Settings > Skills > Marketplace tab — search, install, and uninstall with one click.
- **Chat**: `/skill find <query>`, `/skill add <name>`, `/skill delete <name>`, `/skill list`.

Skills are compatible across Linggen, Claude Code, and Codex (shared [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard).

### Tool Contract

Agents interact with the workspace through a fixed set of Claude Code-style tools:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `Read` | Read file contents (with optional line range) |
| `Write` | Write/overwrite file |
| `Edit` | Exact string replacement within a file |
| `Bash` | Execute shell commands (with timeout) |
| `Glob` | Find files by pattern |
| `Grep` | Search file contents by regex |
| `WebSearch` | Web search via DuckDuckGo |
| `WebFetch` | Fetch and extract content from a URL |
| `Skill` | Invoke a registered skill |
| `AskUser` | Ask the user a question mid-run |
| `Task` | Delegate a task to another agent |
| `capture_screenshot` | Take a screenshot of a URL |
| `lock_paths` / `unlock_paths` | Multi-agent file locking |

### Multi-Agent Runtime

- Agents are spawned by delegation via `Task` — like `fork()`.
- Delegation depth is configurable via `max_delegation_depth` (default 2).
- Capability = tool list: if a session has Write/Edit tools, it can patch. If it has Task, it can delegate.
- Run lifecycle is persisted and cancellation cascades through the run tree.

### Real-time Events

The server publishes SSE events consumed by both Web UI and TUI:

`Token`, `Message`, `AgentStatus`, `SubagentSpawned`, `SubagentResult`, `ContentBlockStart`, `ContentBlockUpdate`, `ToolProgress`, `PlanUpdate`, `Outcome`, `TurnComplete`, `ContextUsage`, `QueueUpdated`, `StateUpdated`.
