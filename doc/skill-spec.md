# Skills

Skill is all you need.

Linggen is like an OS of agents, skill is the interface. Compared with MCP and tools, skills are extendable and self-explained, so we do skills first in Linggen.

Dynamic extensions: format, discovery, triggers, and tool registration.

Skills are the "dynamic libraries" of Linggen — loaded at runtime, callable by any agent, no code changes needed. Everything that isn't a core built-in tool should be a skill.

Linggen skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard (spec: https://agentskills.io/specification). Skills are cross-compatible with Claude Code and Codex.

## Related docs

- `tool-spec.md`: built-in tools (syscall interface).
- `agent-spec.md`: how agents use skills.
- `product-spec.md`: skills-first design principle.

## Format

Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as entrypoint. The directory name should match the `name` field in frontmatter by convention.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── references/        # Detailed docs, loaded on demand
│   └── REFERENCE.md
├── scripts/           # Executable code the model can run
│   └── helper.py
└── assets/            # Static resources (templates, schemas)
```

`SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter + markdown body.

### Progressive disclosure

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): `name` + `description` loaded at startup for all skills.
2. **Instructions** (< 5000 tokens recommended): full `SKILL.md` body loaded on activation.
3. **Resources** (as needed): files in `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` loaded only when required.

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.

### Frontmatter fields

#### Agent Skills standard fields

These fields are defined by the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification) and work across Linggen, Claude Code, and Codex.

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|:------|:---------|:--------|
| `name` | yes | Lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars. Must match directory name. Becomes `/slash-command`. |
| `description` | yes | Max 1024 chars. What the skill does and when to use it. Model reads this to decide. |
| `allowed-tools` | no | Tools permitted when skill is active. |

#### Claude Code extension fields

These fields are defined by Claude Code and also supported by Linggen.

| Field | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `argument-hint` | Autocomplete hint (e.g. `[issue-number]`) |
| `disable-model-invocation` | `true` = only user can invoke |
| `user-invocable` | `false` = only model can invoke |
| `model` | Model preference (`cloud`, `local`, or specific model ID) |
| `context` | `fork` = run in isolated subagent |
| `agent` | Subagent type when `context: fork` |

#### Linggen extension fields

These fields are Linggen-specific extensions.

| Field | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `trigger` | Custom trigger prefix (e.g. `"!!"`, `"%%"`) |
| `app` | App config — makes the skill a directly-runnable app (see below) |
| `permission` | Permission request — user is prompted to approve before skill runs (see below) |
| `install` | Install script — runs once when the skill is installed (see below) |

## Skill install

Skills can declare an `install` field pointing to a script that runs once on installation. The script handles any setup the skill needs — creating directories, copying templates, registering missions.

```yaml
install: scripts/install.sh
```

The script runs with `$SKILL_DIR` set to the skill's directory. It should be **idempotent** — safe to run multiple times (skip files that already exist).

### What install scripts do

- Create directories (e.g. `~/.linggen/memory/`)
- Copy template files from the skill's `assets/` directory
- Copy mission files to `~/.linggen/missions/{name}/` (replaces the old `mission:` frontmatter field)
- Any other one-time setup

### When install scripts run

| Entry point | Trigger |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `ling init` | Runs install scripts for all installed skills |
| WebUI "Install" button | Runs after skill files are copied |
| `ling skills install` | Runs after download and extraction |
| Auto-install on first startup | Runs after built-in skills are downloaded |

All paths converge on the same `run_install_script()` function.

### Example: memory skill

```yaml
name: memory
install: scripts/install.sh
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — Bootstrap memory files and mission
MEMORY_DIR="$HOME/.linggen/memory"
mkdir -p "$MEMORY_DIR"
for f in "$SKILL_DIR/assets/"*.md; do
  target="$MEMORY_DIR/$(basename "$f")"
  [ -f "$target" ] || cp "$f" "$target"
done

MISSION_DIR="$HOME/.linggen/missions/memory"
if [ ! -d "$MISSION_DIR" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$MISSION_DIR"
  cp "$SKILL_DIR/assets/mission.md" "$MISSION_DIR/mission.md"
fi
```

### Mission as an asset

Skills that need a cron mission ship a `mission.md` file in their `assets/` directory. The install script copies it to `~/.linggen/missions/{name}/`. The mission scheduler picks it up automatically (missions are cached in memory and reloaded after skill install).

This replaces the old `mission:` frontmatter field — the mission definition is a file, not a config property.

## Skill permissions

Skills can declare a `permission` field to request elevated access. When a skill with a permission request is invoked, the user is prompted to approve before execution. See `permission-spec.md` for the full permission model.

```yaml
permission:
  mode: admin          # "read", "edit", or "admin"
  paths: ["/", "~"]    # Paths to grant the mode on
  warning: "This skill runs system commands that modify files"
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| `mode` | yes | Required permission mode: `read`, `edit`, or `admin` |
| `paths` | no | Paths to grant the mode on (default: workspace root) |
| `warning` | no | Warning message shown to user before approval |

If a skill only reads data (e.g. search, status checks), it should use `mode: read`. Skills that write files should use `mode: edit`. Skills that run arbitrary shell commands should use `mode: admin`.

## App skills

Skills can act as **apps** — directly executable with a custom UI. When a skill has an `app` section in frontmatter, invoking it opens the UI.

### Two kinds of app skills

| Kind | `allowed-tools` | Model involvement | Example |
|:-----|:-----------------|:------------------|:--------|
| **Standalone** | n/a | None — pure frontend | `arcade-game` (Snake, Pong, Tetris) |
| **Interactive** | any (often `[]`) | App UI talks to ling via session API | `game-table` (chess, poker vs AI) |

Standalone apps bypass the model entirely. Interactive apps create a **session-bound skill** — the app UI creates a session with `skill: "game-table"`, and every message in that session activates the skill (tool restrictions, skill body injection).

### App fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| `launcher` | yes | `web`, `bash`, or `url` |
| `entry` | yes | Filename (web/bash) or URL (url launcher) |
| `width` | no | Suggested panel width in pixels |
| `height` | no | Suggested panel height in pixels |

### Launcher types

| Launcher | Behavior |
|:---------|:---------|
| `web` | Serve skill directory as static files, open in embedded panel (iframe) |
| `bash` | Execute `entry` script, stream output |
| `url` | Open external URL in browser or panel |

### Interactive app pattern

Interactive app skills use the existing linggen API from within the iframe (same-origin):

1. `GET /api/models` — populate model picker
2. `POST /api/sessions` with `skill` field — create skill-bound session
3. `POST /api/run` — send messages to ling (shaped by skill)
4. Events streamed via WebRTC data channel for the session

The skill's `allowed-tools` restricts ling's tools for the session. The skill body is injected into every system prompt. No custom endpoints needed.

### Static file serving

Web apps are served at `/apps/{skill-name}/`. Scoped to skill directory (no path traversal).

## Skill activation modes

| Mode | Trigger | Scope | Tool restriction |
|:-----|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| **Transient** | `/skill-name` in chat | Single invocation | During that run, then restored |
| **Session-bound** | Session created with `skill` field | Entire session | Every message in session |

App skills with interactive UIs are session-bound. The iframe creates the session with the skill binding. All messages in that session get the skill's tool restrictions and instructions.

Session-bound skills combine with the agent's system prompt: `effective_tools = intersection(agent.tools, skill.allowed-tools)`. When effective tools is empty, tool-related prompt sections (schemas, usage guidelines, delegation, plan mode) are skipped entirely.

## Discovery

Skills are discovered at startup and on file change (live reload).

**Discovery paths** (later overrides earlier):

| Priority | Path | Scope |
|:---------|:-----|:------|
| 1 | `~/.linggen/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Global personal |
| 2 | `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/` | Cross-tool compat |
| 3 | `.linggen/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Project (highest priority) |

All skill metadata (name + description + full body) is loaded at startup. Descriptions are included in agent context so the model knows what's available.

## Invocation

Two ways to invoke a skill:

1. **User**: type `/skill-name [args]` in chat.
2. **Model**: model decides to invoke based on description match.

Control who can invoke:
- Default: both user and model.
- `disable-model-invocation: true`: user only.
- `user-invocable: false`: model only.

## Trigger symbols

Parsed from user input only (model output is not parsed):

- `/` — built-in commands + skill invocation.
- `@` — file mentions (aligned with Claude Code).
- Custom triggers declared in frontmatter.

**Matching order**: system triggers → user-defined triggers → pass-through to model.

## Skill tools

Skills can define tool functions via `tools` in their frontmatter. These register dynamically in the tool registry alongside built-in tools. Available only when the skill is active (session-bound or transient invocation).

### Command tools

Execute a shell command with template substitution:

```yaml
tools:
  - name: run_lint
    description: Run project linter
    cmd: "cd $SKILL_DIR && ./scripts/lint.sh {{path}}"
    args:
      path: { type: string, required: true, description: "File to lint" }
```

- Executed via `sh -c` with `{{param}}` substitution.
- `$SKILL_DIR` resolves to the skill's directory path.
- Same timeout and safety validation as the Bash tool.

### Data tools

Pass structured data from the agent to the skill's UI — no shell command, no side effects. Defined by omitting `cmd`:

```yaml
tools:
  - name: DashboardUpdate
    description: Send scan results to the dashboard UI
    args:
      system: { type: object, description: "System info" }
      disk: { type: object, description: "Disk usage" }
```

When the agent calls a data tool:
1. The engine emits a `content_block` event with the tool name and args.
2. The skill app receives it via `onContentBlock` callback (see App skills).
3. The tool returns `"ok"` — the value is in the event, not the return.

Data tools enable **real-time structured updates** from agent to app UI without text-tag parsing hacks. The agent can call them multiple times for incremental updates.

**Implementation**: `engine/skill_tool.rs`, `engine/tool_registry.rs`

### Built-in `PageUpdate` (app skills)

Every skill with an `app` section automatically receives a built-in data tool called `PageUpdate`. Skills do **not** need to declare it in their `tools:` list.

```
PageUpdate({ "page": { <skill-specific layout> } })
```

- Emitted as a `content_block` event; the app iframe receives it via `onContentBlock` and re-renders.
- The `page` argument is opaque to the engine — each skill defines its own layout schema in SKILL.md (e.g. `top_bar`, `body`, `footer` for dashboard-style skills).
- When the active skill has an `app`, the system prompt includes a standing instruction to call `PageUpdate` whenever state the user should see changes. Skills should **not** emit page JSON as text — always use the tool.

This replaces the older `<!--page-->` text-tag convention, which required per-skill parsing and nag loops. Apps can still parse text tags for backward compatibility, but new skills should use `PageUpdate`.

## Cross-tool compatibility

Linggen follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Skills written for Linggen work in Claude Code and Codex — same directory structure, same frontmatter. Claude Code extension fields (`argument-hint`, `disable-model-invocation`, `context`, etc.) are also supported. Linggen-specific fields (`trigger`, `app`) are ignored by other tools.

Skills installed in `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` are discovered by Linggen, Claude Code, and Codex automatically.
