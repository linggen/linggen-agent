# Mission System

Cron-based scheduled agent work. A project can have **multiple active missions** — like a crontab with multiple entries.

## Core concepts

A **mission** is a cron job:

| Field | Required | Description |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| `id` | yes | Unique identifier (generated) |
| `schedule` | yes | Cron expression (5-field standard) |
| `prompt` | yes | The instruction sent to the agent |
| `model` | no | Model override for this mission |
| `permission_tier` | no | `"readonly"`, `"standard"`, or `"full"` (default: `"full"`) — sets the path-mode ceiling on the mission cwd |
| `policy` | no | `"trusted"` (default), `"strict"`, or `"interactive"` — autonomy policy for out-of-scope actions. See `permission-spec.md` → Session policy. |
| `enabled` | yes | Whether this mission is active |
| `created_at` | yes | Timestamp |

### Mission skill

All missions run the **`ling` agent** with the **`mission` skill** bound to the session (`skills/mission/SKILL.md`). The mission skill sets autonomous execution mode:

- **No interactive tools**: `allowed-tools` excludes `AskUser`, `EnterPlanMode`.
- **Work tools**: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`.
- **Delegation**: can use `Task` to spawn sub-tasks for focused work.
- **Self-documenting**: the agent's final message serves as the run report.
- **Auto permissions**: `tool_permission_mode` forced to `Auto` — no human approval gates.

### Cron syntax

Standard 5-field cron: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`.

```
*/30 * * * *        → every 30 minutes
0 9 * * 1-5         → weekdays at 9am
0 0 * * 0           → every Sunday at midnight
0 */2 * * *         → every 2 hours
```

No seconds field. No `@reboot` or non-standard extensions.

## Multiple missions

A project has a **list of missions**, each independently scheduled. Like a crontab file with multiple entries:

```
# Mission 1: Architecture review — daily at 9am
0 9 * * *   "Review code changes and update dependency graphs"

# Mission 2: Disk cleanup — every Sunday
0 0 * * 0   "Analyze disk usage and suggest cleanup"

# Mission 3: Status check — every 30 minutes
*/30 * * * * "Check CI/CD status and report issues"
```

Each mission is independent — its own schedule, prompt, and optional model. Missions can be enabled/disabled individually.

## Session per run

Each mission trigger creates a **new session**. This is the key design difference from interactive chat — the session is the run log.

- **Session title**: `"Mission: {prompt_preview} — {timestamp}"` (prompt truncated to ~50 chars).
- **All tool calls, messages, observations** are recorded in the session — same as a user chat session.
- **Viewable in UI**: mission run sessions appear in the session list and can be opened read-only.
- **Run entry links to session**: `MissionRunEntry` includes `session_id` so the UI can navigate from run history to the session.

## Scheduler behavior

Background task evaluates all enabled missions against their cron schedules:

1. **Tick**: scheduler wakes periodically (every ~10s) and checks all enabled missions.
2. **Match**: for each mission whose cron expression matches the current time window, fire the prompt.
3. **Create session**: create a new session for this run.
4. **Spawn mission agent**: run the `mission` agent in that session with the mission prompt.
5. **Busy skip**: if the mission agent is already running, skip this trigger and log it.
6. **Run record**: each trigger creates a standard `AgentRunRecord` (see `agent-spec.md`) + a `MissionRunEntry`.

### Deduplication

The scheduler tracks the last fire time per mission. A cron match only fires if the current minute differs from the last fire minute — prevents double-firing within the same tick window.

## Run history

Each mission trigger creates:
- A **session** containing the full conversation (tool calls, agent messages).
- An `AgentRunRecord` in `runs/` (standard format).
- A `mission_run` entry in `missions/{id}/runs.jsonl` linking the run to the mission and session.

```json
{ "run_id": "run-mission-1700000000-123456", "session_id": "sess-1700000000-abcd1234", "triggered_at": 1700000000, "status": "completed", "skipped": false }
```

Skipped triggers (agent busy) are also logged with `"skipped": true` and no `session_id`.

## Autonomous permissions

Missions run without a human in the loop. Mission sessions never prompt the user. Two orthogonal levers govern what the agent can do and how out-of-scope actions are handled:

- **`permission_tier`** — sets the capability ceiling (path-mode) on the mission cwd.
- **`policy`** — decides what happens when an action exceeds the ceiling.

See `permission-spec.md` for the full permission model.

- **No AskUser tool**: the mission agent cannot ask questions.
- **No interactive commands**: the agent prompt forbids commands requiring stdin (`git rebase -i`, `vim`, etc.).
- **Config deny rules always apply**: `linggen.toml` deny rules are hard-blocks that no policy can bypass.

### Permission tiers

Each mission has a `permission_tier` that maps to a session permission mode on the mission cwd:

| Tier | Mode | Bash | Use case |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **Read-only** | read | read-class only | Monitoring, analysis |
| **Standard** | edit | write-class + curated prefixes | Build, test, maintenance |
| **Full access** | admin | Unrestricted | Trusted automation |

### Autonomy policy

The `policy:` field controls how the agent handles actions outside the tier's grants:

| Policy | `on_exceed` | `on_ask_rule` | Semantics |
|:-------|:-----------:|:-------------:|:----------|
| **trusted** (default) | allow | deny | Legacy locked-mission behavior. Out-of-scope passes; `ask:` rules (e.g. `git push`) are denied. |
| **strict** | deny | deny | Safer for unattended runs. Out-of-scope fails silently — model course-corrects within the grant. |
| **interactive** | ask | ask | Rare. Opens prompts that nobody is there to click — they queue. Use only for debugging. |

`trusted` is the default to preserve behavior of existing missions. Choose `strict` when the mission should be bounded tightly (e.g. nightly memory extraction limited to `~/.linggen/memory` and `~/.claude`).

### Skill-bound missions

A mission may bind a skill via the session's `skill:` field. When it does, the skill's declared `permission.paths` are applied as path-mode grants at mission start, in addition to the tier grant on cwd. This is how skills like `memory` get narrow admin access (e.g. `~/.linggen`, `~/.claude`) without widening the entire mission cwd.

### Safety

1. **Permission tiers**: users choose the minimum access level needed.
2. **Config deny rules**: hard-block specific commands (e.g., `Bash(rm -rf *)`).
3. **`max_iters` cap**: bounds total tool calls per run.
4. **Daily trigger cap**: 100 triggers per mission per day.
5. **Session audit trail**: every action is logged, fully reviewable.

## Safety

| Guard | Value | Rationale |
|:------|:------|:----------|
| Minimum interval | 1 minute | Cron can't express sub-minute; prevents runaway |
| Max triggers per mission | 100 per day | Caps runaway missions |
| Max concurrent missions | No hard limit | Busy-skip naturally throttles |
| `max_iters` | Per agent config | Bounds each triggered run |
| No mission = no triggers | — | Missions must be explicitly created |
| Disabled missions | Skip silently | `enabled: false` stops all triggers |
| No interactive tools | — | Mission agent cannot block waiting for human input |
| Locked session | Always | No prompts; blocked if action exceeds ceiling. See `permission-spec.md` |
| Config deny rules | Still enforced | Hard-block mechanism for restricting mission capabilities |

## Lifecycle

```
create → enabled → (triggers run on schedule, each run creates a session) → disabled → delete
```

- **Create**: user defines schedule + prompt via Web UI or API.
- **Enable/Disable**: toggle without deleting. Disabled missions keep their config and history.
- **Delete**: removes the mission. Run history and sessions are preserved.
- **Edit**: update schedule, prompt, or model. Takes effect on next tick.

## UI

### Mission editor

- **Schedule**: cron expression with presets.
- **Permissions**: tier selector (Read-only / Standard / Full access) with inline descriptions.
- **Prompt**: the instruction text.
- **Model override**: optional.
- **Agent**: shown as readonly "mission" label — not editable.
- **View agent**: link/button to view `mission.md` content (readonly).

### Run history

Each run entry shows:
- Timestamp, status (completed/failed/skipped).
- Link to the session — opens the full conversation log.

## API operations

| Operation | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| List missions | All missions for a project (with status, last run) |
| Create mission | New mission with schedule + prompt |
| Update mission | Edit schedule, prompt, model, or enabled flag |
| Delete mission | Remove mission (history preserved) |
| Mission runs | Run history for a specific mission (with session links) |

## Implementation

| Module | Responsibility |
|:-------|:---------------|
| `agents/mission.md` | Mission agent definition (autonomous, no AskUser) |
| `mission_scheduler.rs` | Cron evaluation, tick loop, session creation, trigger firing |
| `project_store/missions.rs` | Mission CRUD, run history persistence |
| `server/missions_api.rs` | HTTP endpoints for mission management |
