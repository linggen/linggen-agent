# Chat System

Real-time messaging between users and agents, with streaming output, live activity tracking, and task-oriented conversation structure.

## Related docs

- `agents.md`: agent lifecycle events.
- `tools.md`: tool definitions and safety.

## Architecture overview

The backend engine emits events as agents think and act. Events stream to clients via SSE. The UI consumes events, builds message state, and renders an organized conversation.

```
Backend engine → SSE event stream → UI event dispatcher → chat state → renderer
```

Both the Web UI and TUI consume the same event stream.

## Event categories

Events fall into these categories:

| Category | What it conveys |
|:---------|:----------------|
| Token streaming | Model output tokens, including thinking tokens |
| Messages | Chat messages between user and agent |
| Agent status | High-level state transitions: thinking, working, idle |
| Tool lifecycle | Structured content blocks: tool start, progress, completion |
| Delegation | Subagent spawned, subagent finished |
| Context | Token usage, compression, context window stats |
| Plan | Plan created, updated, approved |
| Queue | User message queued while agent is busy |
| Run outcome | Agent turn finished, files changed |

## Agent status lifecycle

`model_loading` → `thinking` → `calling_tool` → `working` → `idle`

Status events convey high-level transitions. Tool-level detail (which tool, what arguments, success/failure) is conveyed by structured content block events, not status text.

## Message model

Each message carries:

- **Role**: user or agent.
- **Text**: the primary content, rendered as Markdown.
- **Lifecycle state**: whether the message is still being generated (streaming, thinking) or finalized.
- **Activity**: tool calls made during this turn — names, arguments, status, grouped by type.
- **Context stats**: token count, elapsed time, tool call count.
- **Rich content**: subagent delegation tree, structured content blocks, images.

### Message phases

Each agent message progresses through rendering phases:

| Phase | What the user sees |
|:------|:-------------------|
| Thinking | Animated indicator while the model reasons |
| Working | Live activity tree showing tool calls in progress |
| Streaming | Text appearing in real time with a cursor |
| Done | Final message with collapsible activity summary and footer stats |

## Rendering principles

Each chat conversation represents a **task journey** — from the user's question through the agent's reasoning and actions to a final answer. The UI should make this journey clear, organized, and visually rich.
Align WebUI and TUI to Claude Code is the target. 

### 1. Rich, well-ordered messages

Agent messages render as full Markdown: tables, lists, headings, code blocks with syntax highlighting, inline formatting. Content should be concise enough to scan, detailed enough to be useful. No raw JSON, internal status strings, or unformatted tool output in visible messages.

### 2. Live activity tree

While the agent is working, show a tree-structured view of current activity:

- **Primary agent**: tool calls displayed as a grouped, collapsible list (e.g., "Read config.toml", "Edit main.rs") with status indicators (in-progress / done / failed).
- **Subagents** nested under the parent: each delegated agent shown as a branch with its own tool steps, token count, and current status.
- Updates in real time — new tool calls append, completed ones transition from active to done.

### 3. Turn completion summary

When a turn finishes, display a compact summary footer:

- Total tool calls.
- Context tokens used.
- Elapsed time.
- Files changed (if any).

This gives the user an at-a-glance overview of what the agent did.

### 4. Task-oriented conversation structure

Each chat session tells the story of solving a task:

1. **User request** — the question or instruction.
2. **Reasoning** — the agent's thinking and analysis (streaming text, collapsible thinking blocks).
3. **Actions** — tool calls and their results (activity tree, expandable details).
4. **Conclusion** — the final answer, rendered as rich Markdown with clear structure.

The UI should make it easy to follow this narrative: see what the agent explored, understand how it reached its conclusion, and review the final output.

## Rendering pipeline

```
AgentMessage
  ├─ SubagentTreeView (if delegation)
  ├─ ActivitySection (tool calls: grouped, collapsible)
  ├─ TurnSummaryFooter (tool count, tokens, duration)
  └─ MessageBody (thinking indicator, special blocks, markdown)
```

### Special block types

Certain structured payloads render as dedicated widgets:

| Type | Widget | Purpose |
|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| Plan | PlanBlock | Interactive plan approval |
| Finalize | FinalizeBlock | Task completion summary |
| Change report | ChangeReportBlock | File diff summary |
| Ask user | AskUserCard | Agent question with options |

All other content renders as Markdown.

## Message queue

When a user sends a message to a busy agent, it queues. The agent picks it up at the next loop iteration and can react mid-run. This enables the "AI interrupt" pattern — users can redirect, cancel, or query a running agent without waiting.

## Event flow: single agent turn

1. User sends a message.
2. Agent begins thinking — thinking tokens stream to the UI.
3. Agent decides to use a tool — content block events show tool name and arguments.
4. Tool runs — progress events stream output if applicable.
5. Tool completes — content block update marks it done/failed.
6. Agent continues thinking or calls more tools (repeat 3-5).
7. Agent produces a text response — tokens stream as Markdown.
8. Turn completes — summary footer appears with stats.

## API surface

- `POST /api/chat` — send message (queues if busy).
- `GET /api/events` — SSE event stream.
- `GET /api/agent-runs` — list runs for a project/session.
- `GET /api/agent-children` — list child runs (delegation).
- `GET /api/agent-context` — run context and messages.
- `POST /api/agent-cancel` — cancel a run tree.
- `POST /api/ask-user-response` — respond to an AskUser question.
