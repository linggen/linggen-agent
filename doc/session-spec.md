# Session & Context

A session is the fundamental unit of interaction. Each session holds one context — an isolated conversation with its own tools, system prompt, and message history.

## Related docs

- `chat-spec.md`: SSE events, rendering, message model.
- `agent-spec.md`: agent definitions, delegation.
- `skill-spec.md`: skill format, activation.
- `agentic-loop.md`: how the engine runs inside a context.

## Core concept

Session = Context. One session, one context. They are the same thing.

A session is created by a **creator**, which determines the session's initial configuration — tools, system prompt, model. The creator copies its spec into the session. After creation, the session's configuration can change dynamically during the conversation.

## Creators

Every session has a creator that determines how it was born and what capabilities it starts with.

| Creator | How it's created | Typical tools | Example |
|:--------|:-----------------|:-------------|:--------|
| `user` | User clicks "New Chat" in UI or sends first message | All agent tools (`["*"]`) | Normal coding session |
| `skill` | Skill app creates a session via API with `skill` field | Defined by skill's `allowed-tools` | Game-table creates a zero-tool session |
| `agent` | Sub-agent spawned via `Task` tool | Inherits parent's tools | Ling delegates exploration to itself |
| `mission` | Cron scheduler triggers a mission run | Mission agent's tools | Nightly code review mission |

### Creator inheritance

When a session is created, it inherits configuration from its creator:

1. **Agent tools** — base tool set from the agent spec (e.g., `ling` has `["*"]`)
2. **Skill restriction** — if a skill is bound, `effective_tools = intersection(agent.tools, skill.allowed-tools)`
3. **System prompt** — assembled from agent personality + agent body + skill body (if bound)
4. **Model** — from the agent spec or mission config, falling back to the default routing chain

## Session state

Each session carries:

| Field | Set at | Mutable | Purpose |
|:------|:-------|:--------|:--------|
| `id` | creation | no | Unique identifier (`sess-{timestamp}-{uuid8}`) |
| `title` | creation | yes | Human-readable name, can be auto-generated |
| `created_at` | creation | no | Unix timestamp |
| `creator` | creation | no | Who created this session: `user`, `skill`, `agent`, `mission` |
| `skill` | creation | no | Bound skill name (if any) — active for the session's lifetime |
| `agent_id` | creation | yes | Which agent runs in this session |
| `model` | creation | yes | Model override for this session |
| `messages` | runtime | append | Chat history (`messages.jsonl`) |

### What's dynamic (can change during chat)

- **Model** — user can switch models mid-conversation via `/model`
- **Agent** — user can switch agents mid-conversation via `/agent` (tools change accordingly)
- **System prompt** — rebuilt each turn from current agent + skill + environment + project instructions
- **Title** — can be renamed

### What's fixed for the session lifetime

- **Bound skill** — set at creation, cannot be changed. Start a new session for a different skill.
- **Creator** — immutable fact about how the session was born.

## System prompt assembly

The system prompt is rebuilt each turn from layers. Which layers are included depends on the session's current state:

```
[1] Agent personality       — always (sets response style)
[2] Agent body              — always (sets identity and behavior)
[3] Skill body              — when session has a bound skill
[4] Environment             — always (platform, workspace, date)
[5] Project instructions    — when CLAUDE.md exists
[6] Tool schemas            — when effective_tools is non-empty
[7] Tool usage guidelines   — when effective_tools is non-empty
[8] Delegation targets      — when Task tool is in effective_tools
[9] Plan mode instructions  — when effective_tools is non-empty
```

A zero-tool session (e.g., game-table skill with `allowed-tools: []`) gets layers 1-5 only — a minimal, focused prompt for pure conversation.

## Effective tools

The tools available in a session are determined by intersection:

```
effective_tools = agent.tools ∩ skill.allowed_tools (if skill is bound)
                  agent.tools                       (if no skill)
```

- `agent.tools: ["*"]` means all built-in tools.
- `skill.allowed-tools: []` means no tools at all.
- `skill.allowed-tools: ["Read", "Grep"]` means only those tools.
- No `allowed-tools` field means no restriction (falls through to agent tools).

Capabilities are determined by which tools are present:

| Capability | Requires tool |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| Read files | `Read` |
| Write/edit files | `Write`, `Edit` |
| Run commands | `Bash` |
| Search code | `Grep`, `Glob` |
| Delegate to sub-agent | `Task` |
| Web access | `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` |
| Invoke skills | `Skill` |
| Ask the user | `AskUser` |

No separate policy system — the tool list IS the permission model.

## Storage

Sessions live under their creator's namespace:

| Creator | Session path |
|:--------|:------------|
| `user` | `~/.linggen/projects/{encoded}/sessions/{session_id}/` |
| `skill` | `~/.linggen/skills/{skill_name}/sessions/{session_id}/` |
| `mission` | `~/.linggen/missions/{mission_id}/sessions/{session_id}/` |
| `agent` | Ephemeral — not persisted to disk |

Each persisted session directory contains:

```
{session_id}/
  session.yaml      # SessionMeta (id, title, created_at, creator, skill, ...)
  messages.jsonl     # one ChatMsg per line, append-only
```

See `storage-spec.md` for the full filesystem layout.

## Session lifecycle

```
created → active → idle
                 → archived (future: manual or auto-cleanup)
```

- **Created**: session.yaml written, empty messages file.
- **Active**: agent is running, messages being appended.
- **Idle**: no active agent run. Resumes on next user message.

## Sub-agent sessions

When an agent delegates via `Task`, the child runs in its own context (isolated message history, fresh token budget). This is effectively a child session:

- Inherits the parent's model and delegation depth counter.
- Has its own message history (not persisted to disk — ephemeral).
- Results are returned to the parent's context as a tool result.
- The parent's context stays clean — only the summary comes back.

This is how `ling` can delegate exploration to itself: the sub-task runs in an isolated context, does the work, and returns a concise summary.

## API

Session CRUD is part of the projects API:

- `POST /api/sessions` — create session (accepts `skill`, `title`)
- `GET /api/sessions` — list sessions for a project
- `DELETE /api/sessions/:id` — delete a session
- `POST /api/chat` — send message to a session (creates session if needed)
