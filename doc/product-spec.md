# Product Spec: Linggen

## Vision

Linggen is **a local AI app engine — and your general-purpose personal assistant**. Two faces of the same runtime: out of the box, the assistant chats and acts; install skills and the same runtime hosts them as full apps.

Architecturally, Linggen is **the root system for AI agents** — the core runtime manages agent processes, communication, and execution; everything else (skills, agents, missions) grows on top as files. Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard (aligned with Claude Code) and work across AI tools.

For background on why an AI app engine is needed, plus landscape and roadmap, see [`insight.md`](insight.md).

### OS analogy

| OS Concept | Linggen Equivalent |
|:-----------|:-------------------|
| Process | Agentic loop — one running agent |
| Interrupt | User message queue — checked each iteration, model decides |
| Thread/Fork | Subagent delegation — concurrent child execution |
| Syscall | Tool call — built-in tools are the kernel API |
| Dynamic library | Skill — loaded at runtime, no code changes |
| Shell/scripting | Bash tool — model runs shell commands |
| Signal | Cancel, pause — delivered via message queue |
| IPC | Event bus + delegation for inter-agent communication |
| Cron job | Mission — scheduled agent / app / script (multiple per project) |
| Driver | Model provider — Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock |
| Filesystem | Memory store — core markdown + LanceDB RAG via `ling-mem` |
| Process privilege | Permission modes (chat / read / edit / admin) + path scoping |
| User account | `UserContext` — every peer has `user_id`; state filtered per-user |
| Network share | Rooms — share models with peers over P2P WebRTC |

## Design Principles

### 1. Skills-first architecture

Skills are the primary extension mechanism. Built-in tools only for core operations needing safety/state/performance. Everything else (web search, APIs, git workflows) is a skill.

- Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` entrypoint and optional supporting files.
- Adding a skill = dropping a directory. No code changes needed.
- Skill format aligns with Claude Code and the Agent Skills open standard.

### 2. Multi-agent management

- Framework ships with default agents; users create more by dropping `agents/*.md` files.
- Each session has its own context, effective tools, model, and optional bound skill.
- One default agent: `ling` (versatile, adapts to any context via skills). Missions are cron-scheduled tasks, not a separate agent.
- Switch via `/agent <name>` or tab views in web UI.

### 3. Unified CLI and shared sessions

- Single command `ling` starts backend server + opens Web UI.
- All communication over WebRTC data channels.
- Chat messages from any client appear in real-time on all clients.

### 4. Trigger symbols

Parsed from user input only (not model output):

- `/` — built-in commands and skill invocation.
- `@` — mentions, routed to skills for the named target.
- User-defined triggers via skill frontmatter.

### 5. Multi-model routing

Users configure multiple providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock). Named routing policies (`local-first`, `cloud-first`, custom) control which model handles each request. See `models.md`.

### 6. Cross-tool skill ecosystem

- Skills written for Linggen work in Claude Code and Codex (shared Agent Skills standard).
- Users manage all agents, skills, and models from one place.

### 7. Durable memory

The agent remembers who the user is and how to work with them across sessions. Shipped as a skill (`ling-mem`) so the same store is reachable from any AI tool. See `memory-spec.md`.

### 8. Sharing without the cloud

Owners can open rooms to share their models with others. Inference flows P2P over WebRTC — no cloud middleman. See `room-spec.md`.

## Product Goals

- **Root system** — robust core runtime (agentic loop, message queue, agent lifecycle, event bus).
- **Skills-first** — add capabilities by dropping a `SKILL.md`. Built-in tools only for core ops.
- **User interrupt** — users can message a running agent; model sees it and adapts.
- **Multi-agent concurrency** — multiple agents running simultaneously.
- **Unified CLI** — `ling` starts the server and opens the Web UI.
- **Multi-model routing** — named policies (local-first, cloud-first, custom).
- **Cross-tool compatibility** — Agent Skills standard.
- **Durable memory** — persistent identity, preferences, and trajectory across sessions.
- **Own-your-models sharing** — proxy rooms over P2P WebRTC, no cloud middleman.

## Mission System

Schedule-driven work — a crontab with multiple entries. Each mission runs as an agent, an app launch, or a shell script, with its own permission scope and tool/skill allowlist. See [`mission-spec.md`](mission-spec.md).

## Rooms

Owners open private or public rooms to share their models with others. Inference flows over the same P2P WebRTC link as remote access — the relay never sees request bodies. Per-room and per-consumer daily token budgets. See [`room-spec.md`](room-spec.md).

## UX Surface

- **CLI**: `ling` starts backend server + opens Web UI.
- **Web UI**: agent/skill management, session chat, missions, room sharing, settings, memory.
- **Remote access**: P2P WebRTC from anywhere via `linggen.dev`. See `webrtc-spec.md`.
- **Sharing**: open a room; friends connect from `linggen.dev/app`. See `room-spec.md`.

## Safety Requirements

- Workspace-scoped file operations.
- Permission modes (chat / read / edit / admin) with path scoping and a hardcoded deny floor. See `permission-spec.md`.
- Per-user filtering on remote peers.
- Persisted chat/run records; cancellation cascades through run trees.

## Non-goals (early stage)

- Multi-tenant hosted SaaS.
- Unbounded autonomous production deployment.
- Container/VM sandboxing (local trust model).
