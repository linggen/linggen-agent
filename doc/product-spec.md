# Product Spec: Linggen

## Vision

Linggen is **the root system for AI agents**. The core runtime manages agent processes, communication, and execution — everything else grows on top as skills and agents.

Users manage agents, skills, and models through Web UI and TUI. Each agent has its own context, skill set, and mission — from a social chat skill to a coding agent to a scheduled architecture guardian. Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard (aligned with Claude Code) and work across AI tools.

For vision, landscape, and roadmap, see [`insight.md`](insight.md).

### OS analogy

| OS Concept | Linggen Equivalent |
|:-----------|:-------------------|
| Process | Agentic loop — one running agent |
| Interrupt | User message queue — checked each iteration, model decides |
| Thread/Fork | Subagent delegation — concurrent child execution |
| Syscall | Tool call — built-in tools are the kernel API |
| Dynamic library | Skill — loaded at runtime, no code changes |
| Shell/scripting | Bash tool — model runs shell commands |
| Signal | Cancel, pause — delivered via message queue |
| IPC | Event bus + delegation for inter-agent communication |
| Cron job | Mission — cron-scheduled agent task (multiple per project) |
| Driver | Model provider — Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock |

## Design Principles

### 1. Skills-first architecture

Skills are the primary extension mechanism. Built-in tools only for core operations needing safety/state/performance. Everything else (web search, APIs, git workflows) is a skill.

- Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` entrypoint and optional supporting files.
- Adding a skill = dropping a directory. No code changes needed.
- Skill format aligns with Claude Code and the Agent Skills open standard.

### 2. Multi-agent management

- Framework ships with default agents; users create more by dropping `agents/*.md` files.
- Each session has its own context, effective tools, model, and optional bound skill.
- Two default agents: `ling` (versatile, adapts via skills) and `mission` (autonomous scheduled tasks).
- Switch via `/agent <name>` or tab views in web UI.

### 3. Unified CLI and shared sessions

- Single command `linggen` starts backend server + TUI.
- Web UI and TUI share session state via same HTTP/SSE API.
- Chat messages from any client appear in real-time on all clients.

### 4. Trigger symbols

Parsed from user input only (not model output):

- `/` — built-in commands and skill invocation.
- `@` — mentions, routed to skills for the named target.
- User-defined triggers via skill frontmatter.

### 5. Multi-model routing

Users configure multiple providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock). Named routing policies (`local-first`, `cloud-first`, custom) control which model handles each request. See `models.md`.

### 6. Cross-tool skill ecosystem

- Skills written for Linggen work in Claude Code and Codex (shared Agent Skills standard).
- Users manage all agents, skills, and models from one place.

## Product Goals

- **Root system** — robust core runtime (agentic loop, message queue, agent lifecycle, event bus).
- **Skills-first** — add capabilities by dropping a `SKILL.md`. Built-in tools only for core ops.
- **User interrupt** — users can message a running agent; model sees it and adapts.
- **Multi-agent concurrency** — multiple agents running simultaneously.
- **Unified CLI** — serves both TUI and web UI from shared backend.
- **Multi-model routing** — named policies (local-first, cloud-first, custom).
- **Cross-tool compatibility** — Agent Skills standard.

## Mission System

Cron-based scheduled agent work — like a crontab with multiple entries.

- **No missions** → agents are purely reactive (human-in-the-loop).
- **Active missions** → agents triggered on cron schedules, each with its own prompt.

A project can have **multiple active missions**. Each mission defines a cron schedule, target agent, prompt, and optional model override. Missions are independent — enable, disable, or edit them individually. See [`mission-spec.md`](doc/mission-spec.md) for full details.

## UX Surface

- **CLI**: `ling` starts backend server + TUI.
- **Web UI**: agent/skill management, session chat, agent tab views, mission page, settings, memory.
- **Agent switching**: `/agent <name>` or tab views.
- **Remote access**: power users proxy the Web UI remotely (SSH tunnel, reverse proxy). Future: built-in secure proxy or WebRTC.

## Safety Requirements

- Workspace-scoped file operations.
- Allowlisted command execution.
- Persisted chat/run records.
- Cancellation cascades through run trees.
- See `tool-spec.md` for details.

## Non-goals (early stage)

- Multi-tenant hosted SaaS.
- Unbounded autonomous production deployment.
- Container/VM sandboxing (local trust model).
