# Agents

Process management: agent types, lifecycle, delegation, concurrency, and scheduling.

## Related docs

## Agent types

Agents are discovered dynamically from `agents/*.md` markdown files. No hardcoded roster.

- **Main agents**: long-lived, receive user tasks, can delegate.
- **Subagents**: ephemeral child workers, spawned by delegation.

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|:------|:---------|:--------|
| `name` | yes | Agent identity |
| `description` | yes | What the agent does (used for discovery and delegation) |
| `tools` | yes | Tool declarations (used for prompt assembly). The session's effective path mode controls actual access — see `permission-spec.md`. |
| `personality` | no | Response style guide — concise directive for HOW the agent communicates |

Runtime configuration (model, effective tools, bound skill) is set at the session level. See `session-spec.md`.

### Ling: the general-purpose agent

Ling is the primary agent — like Jarvis, one agent that adapts to any context. Skills shape ling's behavior:

- **Skill body** → injected into system prompt as domain instructions
- **Skill `allowed-tools`** → narrows ling's `tools: ["*"]`
- **Dynamic prompt** → engine only includes instructions for capabilities available

When a skill sets `allowed-tools: []`, tool-related prompt sections (schemas, usage guidelines, delegation, plan mode) are skipped. Ling becomes a pure conversational agent shaped by the skill's instructions.

### Default agents

| Agent | Role | Key tools |
|:------|:-----|:----------|
| `ling` | The only agent — adapts to any context via skills | `["*"]` |

Ling is the universal agent. Specialized behavior comes from skills:
- **Mission skill** — bound to cron sessions, sets autonomous execution mode with safety guardrails
- **Game-table skill** — bound to game sessions, zero tools, pure conversation
- **Linggen-guide skill** — documentation lookup and Q&A

### Dynamic system prompt

The system prompt is assembled from layers:

1. **Personality** (from agent frontmatter) — always present, sets response style
2. **Agent body** (from agent .md) — always present, sets identity and adaptation rules
3. **Skill frame** (from active SKILL.md) — when skill is active
4. **Environment** — platform, workspace
5. **Project instructions** (CLAUDE.md) — when present
6. **Tool schemas + guidelines** — only when effective tools is non-empty
7. **Delegation targets** — only when Task tool is available
8. **Memory** — only when Write tool is available

This means a game session (no tools) gets a minimal, focused prompt. A coding session gets the full tool-aware prompt. Same agent, different context.

## Lifecycle

```
created → running → completed | failed | cancelled
```

Each execution is an `AgentRunRecord`:
- `run_id`, `repo_path`, `session_id`, `agent_id`
- `agent_kind` (main | subagent)
- `parent_run_id` (for delegated runs)
- `status`, `detail`, `started_at`, `ended_at`

**Implementation**: `agent_manager/mod.rs`

## Delegation (fork)

`Task` spawns a child agent loop — like `fork()`:

- Parent collects consecutive delegations, spawns concurrently via `JoinSet`.
- Each child gets its own isolated engine and tokio runtime.
- Parent waits for all children, feeds results back into its context.
- Depth tracked and limited by `agent.max_delegation_depth` (default 2).
- Cancellation cascades from parent to children.

**Delegation rules**:
- `main → main` messaging: allowed.
- `main → subagent` delegation: allowed.
- `subagent → parent` return: allowed.
- `subagent → subagent`: denied.
- `subagent → spawn(*)`: denied.

## Capabilities

Capabilities are determined by which tools are available in the session — no separate policy system. See `session-spec.md` for the effective tools model.

Tool access is hard-gated by the session's effective tool set. Wildcard `tools: ["*"]` means unrestricted.

## Mission system (scheduler)

Cron-based scheduled agent work. A project can have **multiple active missions** — each with its own cron schedule, target agent, and prompt.

- **No missions** → agents purely reactive.
- **Active missions** → agents triggered on cron schedules.

See [`mission-spec.md`](mission-spec.md) for full details: cron syntax, scheduling behavior, safety guards, run history, and API.

## Concurrency model

- Each agent holds a lock during execution (`agent.try_lock()`).
- Multiple agents can run concurrently (different locks).
- Messages to a busy agent are queued (see `agentic-loop.md`).
- Subagents spawned via delegation run on separate tokio runtimes.
