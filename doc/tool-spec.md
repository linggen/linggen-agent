# Tools

Syscall interface: built-in tools, safety rules, and the two-tier model.

## Related docs

- `session-spec.md`: effective tools, capability model.
- `skill-spec.md`: dynamic extensions (skill tools).
- `agentic-loop.md`: how tools are dispatched in the loop.
- `agent-spec.md`: agent tool declarations.

## Two-tier model

| Tier | What | Why built-in |
|:-----|:-----|:-------------|
| **Built-in tools** | Core coding ops | Need safety enforcement, internal state, or performance |
| **Skills** | Everything else | Extensible, replaceable, no code changes |

Built-in tools are the kernel API. Skills are userspace.

## Built-in tools

| Tool | Args | Purpose |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|
| `Glob` | `globs?, max_results?` | File pattern matching |
| `Read` | `path, max_bytes?, line_range?` | Read file contents |
| `Grep` | `query, globs?, max_results?` | Content search (ripgrep) |
| `Write` | `path, content` | Create/overwrite file |
| `Edit` | `path, old_string, new_string, replace_all?` | String replacement in file |
| `Bash` | `cmd, timeout_ms?` | Shell command execution |
| `capture_screenshot` | `url, delay_ms?` | Web page screenshot |
| `lock_paths` | `globs, ttl_ms?` | Acquire file locks (multi-agent) |
| `unlock_paths` | `tokens` | Release file locks |
| `Task` | `target_agent_id, task` | Spawn subagent |
| `WebSearch` | `query, max_results?` | Web search (DuckDuckGo) |
| `WebFetch` | `url, max_bytes?` | Fetch URL content as text |
| `Skill` | `skill, args?` | Invoke a skill by name |
| `RunApp` | `skill, args?` | Launch an app-enabled skill |
| `AskUser` | `questions` | Ask user structured questions mid-execution |
| `EnterPlanMode` | `reason?` | Enter plan mode (research-only) |
| `ExitPlanMode` | `plan_text` | Exit plan mode with completed plan |
| `UpdatePlan` | `plan_text?, items?` | Update plan progress during execution |

**Aliases**: `Read`/`Write`/`Edit` accept `file`/`filepath` for `path`. `Edit` accepts `old`/`search`/`from` for `old_string`, `new`/`replace`/`to` for `new_string`.

Tool names follow Claude Code convention (capitalized).

## AskUser

Lets the agent pause mid-loop to ask the user structured questions. Aligned with Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`.

- **1-4 questions** per call, each with 2-6 selectable options.
- User can always type custom text ("Other").
- Blocks the agent loop until user responds (5 min timeout).
- Not available in delegated sub-agents — returns error.
- Not available in CLI mode.
- UI renders an inline card with option buttons in the chat stream.
- Cancelling the agent run unblocks the tool gracefully.

**Flow**: tool emits `AskUser` event → UI renders card → user submits via `POST /api/ask-user-response` → oneshot channel delivers answer → loop continues.

**Implementation**: `engine/tools.rs` (execution), `server/chat_api.rs` (response endpoint), `ui/src/components/AskUserCard.tsx` (UI).

## RunApp

Launches an app-enabled skill. The skill must have an `app` section in its frontmatter with a `launcher` type. See `skill-spec.md` → App skills.

- **`web`**: serves the skill directory as static files at `/apps/{skill-name}/`, emits `AppLaunched` event, UI opens an iframe panel.
- **`bash`**: executes the entry script in the skill directory, returns stdout/stderr.
- **`url`**: emits `AppLaunched` event with the external URL, UI opens in panel or new tab.

**Direct invocation**: when a user invokes an app skill via `/skill-name`, the server short-circuits the model — executes the app directly without entering the agent loop.

**Model invocation**: any agent can call `RunApp` to launch an app during a conversation (e.g., "let me open the dashboard for you").

**event**: `AppLaunched { skill, launcher, url, title, width?, height? }` — tells the UI to open the app panel.

**Implementation**: `engine/tools/delegation.rs` (`run_app()`), `server/chat_api.rs` (direct dispatch), `server/mod.rs` (static serving at `/apps/`), `ui/src/components/AppPanel.tsx` (UI).

## Tool dispatch

Dispatch order in `ToolRegistry.execute()`:

1. **Builtins** — canonical name match.
2. **Skill tools** — HashMap lookup.
3. **Unknown** — error.

**Implementation**: `engine/tool_registry.rs`, `engine/tools.rs`

## Access control

Session permission mode controls which tools are available. See `permission-spec.md` for the full model.

- **Four modes**: chat (no tools), read, edit, admin — each a ceiling on what the agent can do.
- **Path-scoped**: permissions are tied to directory trees, aligned with OS ownership (home vs system).
- **Deny/ask rules**: configured in `linggen.toml` to hard-block or force-prompt specific commands.
- Write-safety mode: checks that file was Read before Write/Edit.
- Redundancy detection: cache + loop-breaker for repeated calls.

**Flow**: permission gate in `handle_tool_action()` → classify action tier → check deny/ask rules → check path zone + mode ceiling → emit `AskUser` event if needed → proceed or block.

**Implementation**: `engine/permission.rs`, `engine/tool_exec.rs`, `ui/src/components/ToolPermissionCard.tsx`.

## File safety

- All paths sanitized to workspace root.
- Parent traversal (`..`) rejected.
- Absolute paths outside workspace rejected.
- File listing/search use ignore-aware walking.

## Bash safety

- Commands executed via `sh -c` in workspace root.
- Timeout enforced (default 30s).
- Output captured (stdout + stderr).
- Workspace-scoped: working directory set to workspace root.
