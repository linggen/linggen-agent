# Code Style Specification

## Goals

- Keep code easy to read, maintain, and refactor.
- Keep files and functions at a manageable size.
- Prefer simple, flat control flow over deep nesting.
- Keep the codebase clean by removing dead and legacy-only code.

## File and Function Size

- Keep source files at a reasonable length; split large files into focused modules.
- Keep functions short and focused on one responsibility.
- If a file or function becomes long or hard to navigate, refactor early.
- Refactoring is expected, not optional, when complexity grows.

## Flat Logic First

- Prefer guard clauses and early returns.
- Avoid deep nested `if/else` and nested `match` chains where flattening is possible.
- Extract nested logic into helper functions with clear names.
- Keep async control flow explicit and easy to trace.

## Clean Code Policy

- Remove unused code, old branches, and stale utilities.
- Do not keep compatibility/fallback code when current logic is confirmed and stable.
- Keep reliability fallbacks that are required for system safety and operations (for example offline startup, retry, rollback, and recovery paths).
- Remove dead feature flags and temporary migration paths after rollout is complete.
- Keep imports, structs, and modules free of unused fields and APIs.

## Refactoring Triggers

- Repeated logic appears in multiple places.
- Function has multiple unrelated responsibilities.
- Nested flow makes behavior hard to reason about.
- A change requires touching too many unrelated lines.

## Review Checklist

- Is the file still easy to scan?
- Is the function size still reasonable?
- Can nesting be flattened?
- Is there unused or obsolete code that should be deleted?
