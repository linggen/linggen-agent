# Agentic Loop

The kernel of linggen. Every agent run — chat, idle prompt, delegation — is one loop instance.

- `chat-spec.md`: IPC, message queue.

## Loop iteration

```
for iter in 0..max_iters {
    1. Check cancellation          → abort if cancelled
    2. Check user message queue    → inject into context if present
    3. Build context               → system prompt + history + observations
    4. Call model                  → streaming response
    5. Parse actions               → tool calls, delegation, done
    6. Execute actions             → dispatch tools, spawn subagents
    7. Feed observations           → results back into history
}
```

**Termination**: Done (plain text answer), Patch, FinalizeTask, EnterPlanMode, cancellation, or `max_iters` reached.

Same loop for all execution types: user chat, idle prompt, delegation.

**Implementation**: `engine/mod.rs` → `run_agent_loop()`

## User message queue (interrupt)

While the loop runs, users can send messages. These are queued per-agent.

At the **top of each iteration**, the engine checks the queue. If present, messages are injected into context. The model then decides:

| User says | Model decides |
|:----------|:-------------|
| "cancel" | Stop loop, report progress |
| "wait" | Pause, ask what's up |
| "change to X" | Adapt plan, continue |
| "progress?" | Report status, continue |

This is **cooperative interruption** — the loop yields at each iteration boundary. The model handles all interrupt logic, no hardcoded signal handlers.

Messages are queued per-agent and checked at each iteration boundary via an interrupt channel.

## Cancellation (signals)

- Checked at loop entry and before/after each tool execution.
- `cancel_run_tree()` cascades to all descendants.
- Run status persisted (`running` → `cancelled`).
- User can also cancel via message queue (model decides to stop gracefully).

**Implementation**: `agent_manager/mod.rs` → `is_run_cancelled()`, `cancel_run_tree()`

## Context management

- Context is built from system prompt + conversation history + tool observations.
- When context approaches token limit, automatic compaction summarizes older messages using model-based summarization (falls back to deterministic extraction on failure).
- `/compact [focus]` command forces compaction regardless of budget. Optional focus parameter guides the summarizer to emphasize specific topics.
- High/Critical importance messages survive compaction; Low/Normal messages are summarized.
- Tool results are trimmed to fit within limits.
- Read cache invalidated after Write/Edit to keep observations fresh.

## Guardrails

The loop includes gates and streak detection:

- **Permission gate** — destructive tools (`Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Patch`) require user approval when `tool_permission_mode = "ask"`. See `tools.md`.
- Empty search results → nudge to broaden query.
- Redundant tool calls → nudge to try different approach.
- Invalid JSON parsing → retry hint.
- Repetition detection → loop breaker prompt.
