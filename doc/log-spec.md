# Sanji Logging Specification

## Goals

- Make sure AI coding tool like Claude code can locate and fix bug.
- Log all important steps in each service lifecycle and data path.
- Keep logs easy to read and easy to analyze in development and production.
- Prevent log storms with throttling and rate limits.

## Output Targets

- Debug console (service runtime / terminal).
- Browser console (for web-facing components and dashboards).
- File logs (persistent records for troubleshooting and audits). Current runtime rotates daily and applies retention cleanup (default 30 days).

## Required Logging Coverage

- Startup, initialization, ready, shutdown.
- Dependency wait/retry/connect/disconnect events.
- Health transitions: ready, degraded, failed, recovered.
- Restart and fail-safe events.
- Key processing milestones and major errors.

## Log Levels

- `DEBUG`: developer diagnostics and detailed state changes.
- `INFO`: normal important workflow milestones.
- `WARN`: retry loops, degraded state, non-fatal abnormal conditions.
- `ERROR`: fatal failures, panics, unrecoverable conditions.

## Readability and Format

- Use consistent, structured format (JSON lines recommended for files).
- Use concise human-readable message text.
- Include key context fields (service, module, event, correlation/request id if available).
- Color and icon usage is recommended for console output to improve scanability.

## Throttling and Rate Limiting

- Always throttle repeated high-frequency logs.
- Apply per-event throttling for noisy loops (for example retry and polling loops).
- Aggregate repeated messages into summary lines when possible.
- Protect console and file outputs from flush storms.

## Environment Behavior

- Development: allow richer `DEBUG` logs with color/icon formatting.
- Production: default to `INFO`, keep structure stable, and prioritize signal over noise.
