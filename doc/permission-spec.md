# Permission System

Controls what agents can do, who can grant access, and how trust flows across local, remote, and proxy contexts.

## Related docs

- `tool-spec.md`, `session-spec.md`, `agent-spec.md`, `mission-spec.md`, `webrtc-spec.md`, `proxy-spec.md`.

## Core principle

**Session is the single source of truth for permissions. Every permission must be preset or approved by the user.** No tool permissions in agent specs, skill frontmatter defines requests not grants. The agent cannot gain capabilities without explicit human consent.

## Design principles

1. **Nothing auto-allowed.** All tool access requires explicit user consent — preset via config or approved at runtime.
2. **Deny wins.** A deny rule blocks regardless of allows elsewhere.
3. **Inner layer can only tighten.** Subagents restrict, never expand.
4. **Prompt only when someone can answer.** Missions and proxy sessions use pre-configured permissions only.
5. **Classify the action, not the tool.** `Bash("ls")` is a read; `Bash("rm -rf /")` is admin. Permission reflects what the command *does*.
6. **Session is the permission boundary.** Each session has its own permission state. No project-level persistence.
7. **Align with OS filesystem ownership.** Home directory is user space — mode switching allowed. System directories require per-action approval — no persistent write grants. This mirrors Unix (`~/` vs `/etc`) and Windows (`%USERPROFILE%` vs `C:\Windows`).

## Modes and tools

Session mode controls which tools are available. No tool permissions in agent specs, skill frontmatter, or elsewhere — **session is the single source of truth**.

| Mode | What's available |
|:-----|:-----------------|
| **chat** | No tools |
| **read** | `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `WebSearch`, `capture_screenshot`, plan tools, `AskUser`, read-class Bash, `Memory_query` |
| **edit** | Everything in read + `Write`, `Edit`, write-class Bash, `Memory_write` |
| **admin** | Everything. (No Linggen-defined capability tool currently requires admin tier — the deprecated `Memory_forget` was removed from the model surface; bulk-forget runs via the dashboard or `ling-mem forget` CLI under explicit user invocation.) |

### Bash classification

Bash is the only tool whose mode depends on the command. Each command is classified:

| Class | Examples |
|:------|:---------|
| **read** | `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `find`, `grep`, `git status/log/diff/show/branch`, `cargo check`, `npm list` |
| **write** | `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `git add/commit/push`, `npm install/run`, `cargo build/test` |
| **admin** | `rm`, `sudo`, `kill`, `chmod`, `docker`, `systemctl`, unknown commands |

Compound commands: classified by highest component. Unknown: admin-class.

## Path zones

The filesystem is divided into zones, aligned with OS ownership:

| Zone | Unix/macOS | Windows | Mode switch | Writes |
|:-----|:-----------|:--------|:-----------|:-------|
| **Home** | `~/` | `%USERPROFILE%` | Yes | Within mode ceiling |
| **Temp** | `/tmp`, `/var/tmp` | `%TEMP%` | Yes | Within mode ceiling |
| **System** | Everything else | `C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files` | **No** | **Per-action only** |

**Sensitive home paths** (`~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws`, `.git/`, `.linggen/`) behave like system zone — per-action approval for writes, no mode switch.

## Permission modes

Four modes. Each defines a ceiling — the max tier the agent can access on a given path.

| Mode | Ceiling | What the agent can do |
|:-----|:--------|:---------------------|
| **chat** | chat | Converse only. No tools. |
| **read** | read | Read, search, inspect. |
| **edit** | edit | Read + write/edit files. |
| **admin** | admin | Everything including Bash, web, system ops. |

**Default: read**, scoped to the session's starting directory.

### Modes are path-scoped

A mode grant is always `(path, mode)`. The grant covers the path and all children. Each session stores a list of grants in `permission.json`:

```json
{
  "path_modes": [
    { "path": "~/workspace/linggen", "mode": "edit" },
    { "path": "/etc/nginx", "mode": "read" }
  ]
}
```

Most specific matching path wins.

### Mode upgrades

When the agent exceeds the current path's ceiling (home/temp zone), the prompt for that specific tool call includes a mode switch option:

```
Agent wants to edit src/main.rs

  [Switch to edit mode]     ← grants edit on ~/workspace/linggen/**
  [Allow once]              ← one-time, mode stays the same
  [Deny]
```

"Switch to edit mode" persists in `permission.json`. Future edits and write-class Bash within that tree pass without prompting. This applies to all tool types — Edit, Write, and write-class Bash all show the mode switch option when they exceed the ceiling.

### Directory changes

When the working directory changes (`! cd ~/other-project`):

- If the new path has an existing grant → that mode applies.
- If no grant covers it → effective mode resets to **read**.

Edit mode on project A does not leak to project B.

### Reading outside granted paths

If the agent reads a file not covered by any grant:

```
Agent wants to read /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

  [Allow read on /etc/nginx]    ← grants read for the session
  [Allow once]
  [Deny]
```

### System zone writes

No mode switch offered. Always per-action:

```
Agent wants to edit /etc/hosts

  [Allow once]
  [Deny]
```

### Mode in chat widget

Current effective mode shown in chat header, updates on directory change:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Session: "Fix auth bug"     [edit ▾]    │
│  ~/workspace/linggen                     │
```

Clicking the badge opens a dropdown to switch modes for the current path.

### Locked flag

Not a mode — a flag. When locked, prompts are skipped; actions that would need prompting are blocked instead. Used for missions, CI, remote-different-user sessions.

## Permission layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Config (linggen.toml)           │  Deny/ask rules, default mode
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. Session (permission.json)       │  Path modes, policy, session allows, denied sigs
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Config sets guardrails. Session holds runtime state. That's it.

## Session policy

Mode sets the *capability ceiling* on each path. **Policy** decides what happens when an action exceeds the ceiling or hits an ask-rule. The two concepts are orthogonal and compose: mode = what the agent is allowed to do, policy = behavior when it wants more.

Two independent levers:

| Lever | When it applies | Choices |
|:------|:----------------|:--------|
| **on_exceed** | Action exceeds effective path-mode grant | `ask` / `allow` / `deny` |
| **on_ask_rule** | Action matches an `ask:` rule | `ask` / `allow` / `deny` |

Deny rules always deny — policy cannot override the safety floor.

Named presets:

| Preset | `on_exceed` | `on_ask_rule` | When to use |
|:-------|:-----------:|:-------------:|:------------|
| **interactive** | ask | ask | Default for user-facing sessions |
| **strict** | deny | deny | Autonomous runs where safety matters more than coverage |
| **trusted** | allow | deny | Autonomous runs you trust — legacy locked-session behavior |
| **sandbox** | allow | allow | Containerized/Docker runs where the OS is the guardrail |

Policy applies to the *whole session*. It's set by:

- Interactive user sessions → `interactive` (default)
- Consumer (proxy-room) sessions → `trusted` (no prompts, still denies `ask:` rules like `git push`)
- Mission sessions → declared in the mission's `policy:` field, defaults to `strict`. `trusted` / `sandbox` are opt-in for missions that need out-of-scope actions to pass. `interactive` is discouraged — prompts queue unseen.

A policy where either lever is not `ask` is *locked* — the agent never prompts the user in that session.

## Permission rules (deny / ask)

Two types in config. Deny takes priority over ask.

| Type | Effect |
|:-----|:-------|
| **deny** | Block immediately, no prompt, no override |
| **ask** | Always prompt, even if mode would allow. User can override per-session. |

Rules are always scoped: `Tool(pattern)`.

```toml
[permissions]
deny = ["Bash(sudo *)", "Bash(rm -rf *)"]
ask = ["Bash(git push *)", "Bash(docker *)"]
```

No config `allow` rules — within-ceiling actions are already allowed by the mode. Use `ask` to add friction for specific commands; use `deny` to hard-block.

## Check flow

```
 1. Tool in agent's effective set? NO → blocked
 2. Classify action tier (read / edit / admin)
 3. Check deny rules → blocked (hard floor, not overridable)
 4. Check ask rules (config + not in session allows):
      policy.on_ask_rule = ask   → prompt
      policy.on_ask_rule = allow → skip the rule
      policy.on_ask_rule = deny  → blocked
 5. Resolve target path + zone
 6. If an explicit path grant covers the target and satisfies the tier → allowed
    (skill-declared grants short-circuit zone and ceiling checks)
 7. System zone + write/admin?
      policy.on_exceed = ask   → per-action prompt
      policy.on_exceed = allow → allowed
      policy.on_exceed = deny  → blocked
 8. Find effective mode for path:
      Within ceiling            → allowed
      Exceeds / no grant, and
        policy.on_exceed = ask   → prompt
        policy.on_exceed = allow → allowed
        policy.on_exceed = deny  → blocked
```

## Prompt options

**Actions within the mode ceiling on a granted path never prompt.** Three cases trigger prompts:

### Exceeds mode ceiling (home/temp zone)

1. Allow once
2. Switch to {mode} mode — persists `(current_path, mode)` in `permission.json`
3. Deny
4. Other...

After switching, all actions within the new ceiling pass without prompting.

### System zone writes

No mode switch. Always per-action:

1. Allow once
2. Deny

### Ask-rule override

Config `ask` rules force a prompt even within the ceiling. Example: `ask = ["Bash(git push *)"]` prompts in admin mode.

1. Allow once
2. Allow for this session — suppresses the ask rule for this session
3. Deny

## Session persistence

`~/.linggen/sessions/{session_id}/permission.json`:

```json
{
  "path_modes": [
    { "path": "~/workspace/linggen", "mode": "edit" }
  ],
  "locked": false,
  "allows": ["Bash:git push *"],
  "denied_sigs": ["Bash:rm -rf dist"]
}
```

`allows` stores ask-rule overrides — commands the user approved to suppress config `ask` rules for this session. `denied_sigs` stores tool calls the user denied (auto-blocked on retry).

No project-level `permissions.json`. Two persistent sources: `linggen.toml` (global) and session `permission.json` (per-session, cleared on session end).

## Session creators

Three ways to create a session, each with different initial permissions:

### User session

- Starts in **read** mode on the current directory.
- User upgrades mode interactively as needed.
- This is the default.

### Mission session

- Mode (`read` / `edit` / `admin`) and paths set in the mission's `permission:` block.
- Policy (`strict` / `trusted` / `sandbox` / `interactive`) defaults to `strict`; see mission-spec.md.
- Always **locked** — no prompts, pre-configured permissions only (`interactive` is discouraged).
- Config deny rules still apply.
- Session promotion (user sends message) clears locked flag, resets to interactive.

### Skill invocation (within a user session)

Skills don't create sessions — they run inside the current user session. Skills that need elevated permissions declare it in frontmatter. Example from the `sys-doctor` skill:

```yaml
---
name: sys-doctor
description: System health analyst — scans disk, apps, caches, and system info
permission:
  mode: admin
  paths: ["/"]
  warning: "Sys Doctor runs diagnostic commands (df, du, sysctl, uname) and the AI may suggest cleanup commands."
---
```

When the user invokes the skill (click card, `/sys-doctor`, etc.):

```
Skill "sys-doctor" requests:
  admin mode on /
  ⚠️ Sys Doctor runs diagnostic commands (df, du, sysctl, uname)
    and the AI may suggest cleanup commands.

  [Approve]           ← grants (/, admin) in session permission.json
  [Run in read mode]  ← skill runs with current permissions, may fail
  [Cancel]
```

If approved, the grants are added to the **current session's** `permission.json`. The skill runs within the session with those grants. The grants persist in the session — user can revoke via the mode dropdown.

Skills without a `permission` section run with whatever the session already has.

## Remote access

| Context | Mode cap | Locked | Prompts |
|:--------|:---------|:-------|:--------|
| Local browser (owner) | Any | No | Yes |
| Remote same-user (owner) | Any | No | Yes |
| Remote different-user (guest) | Owner-set (default: read) | Yes | No |
| Proxy consumer (browser) | Room config ceiling | Yes | No |

Guest and consumer sessions are always locked — no prompts, actions within ceiling + allow rules proceed, everything else blocked. For proxy consumers, the room config (`allowed_tools`, `allowed_skills`) is the hard ceiling — the consumer's permission level operates within it.


## Subagents

- Inherit parent's session permission state (mode, path grants, session allows).
- Can only tighten. Cannot upgrade mode (no AskUser).
- Locked if parent is locked.

## Configuration

```toml
[agent]
tool_permission_mode = "read"    # Default mode for new sessions

[permissions]
deny = ["Bash(sudo *)", "Bash(rm -rf *)"]
ask = ["Bash(git push *)", "Bash(docker *)"]
```

## Future

- **Safety classifier**: model-based Bash classification for smarter auto-decisions.
- **OS sandbox**: Seatbelt (macOS) / bubblewrap (Linux) for defense-in-depth.
- **Hooks**: pre/post-tool-use hooks for programmatic permission decisions.
