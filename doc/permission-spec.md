# Permission System

Controls what agents can do, where they can do it, and how access changes as the working folder changes.

## Core principle

**A permission is always `(path, mode)`.** The session keeps a list of grants. The effective mode for the current working folder is the most-specific matching grant — or `chat` (no tools) if no grant covers it. If the agent needs a tier higher than the effective mode, interactive sessions prompt; non-interactive runs (missions, proxy consumers) pause or fail.

There is no separate config rule layer, no per-tool ask/deny patterns, and no "reads are free" carveout. Every action — read, write, bash, anything — gates on the same `(path, mode)` lookup.

### What's gated, and what isn't

**The permission system gates the agent. The user is never gated.**

| Actor | Path | Permission check |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Agent's in-process tools (`Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, capability tools) | Through `check_permission` | Yes — path-mode + hardcoded deny floor |
| User-typed `!`-shortcut in chat | `POST /api/bash` | No |
| Skill iframe JS calling backend (e.g. dashboard widgets) | `POST /api/bash` etc. | No |

Rationale: the user is the authority on their own machine. The permission system exists because the model is unpredictable and prompt-injectable — those failure modes don't apply to commands the user typed or to deterministic skill-bundled code the user already approved at skill activation. The hardcoded deny floor is an *agent-only* safety net, not a universal block.

## Modes and tools

| Mode | What's available |
|:-----|:-----------------|
| **chat** | `Skill` only (navigation primitive — always allowed). Any other tool the agent attempts triggers an upgrade prompt offering to switch the folder to the needed tier. The user can Allow once, Switch persistently, or Deny. |
| **read** | `Skill` + `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `capture_screenshot`, plan tools, `AskUser`, read-class Bash, `Memory_query` |
| **edit** | Everything in read + `Write`, `Edit`, write-class Bash, `Memory_write` |
| **admin** | Everything in edit + admin-class Bash |

`Skill` always bypasses the path-mode check — without it, a chat-mode session could never invoke a skill via natural language. The activated skill then runs through its own permission flow (its `permission:` block, if declared).

Chat mode is *not* a hard wall. It is the lowest tier — every concrete action exceeds it, so the user gets a per-action upgrade prompt. Chat is "default-deny but ask"; pick it when you want explicit approval for every tool the agent uses.

### Bash classification

Bash is the only tool whose tier depends on the command. Each command is classified:

| Class | Examples |
|:------|:---------|
| **read** | `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `find`, `grep`, `git status/log/diff/show/branch`, `cargo check`, `npm list` |
| **write** | `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `git add/commit/push`, `npm install/run`, `cargo build/test` |
| **admin** | `kill`, `chmod`, `docker`, `systemctl`, unknown commands |

Compound commands: classified by the highest component. Unknown commands: admin-class.

### Bash path-arg gating

Bash gates on **the paths the command actually touches**, not just the session cwd. Absolute (`/foo`) and tilde (`~/foo`) tokens in the command are extracted; each must be covered by a grant at the command's tier.

- `ls` (no path args) → cwd's tier must cover read.
- `ls /tmp/foo` → `/tmp` must have read; cwd's tier is irrelevant.
- `cat /etc/hosts > /tmp/x` → both `/etc/hosts` (read) and `/tmp/x` (write) checked.
- `bash ~/scripts/foo.sh` → admin tier required on `~/scripts/foo.sh` (or its parent grant).

This prevents `read on /A, cwd /A` from leaking into `bash ls /B` — `/B` would prompt for upgrade. Best-effort extraction: doesn't parse `--flag=/path` forms or quoted paths with spaces. Compound commands (`a; b`, `a && b`) are split and each path checked.

### Per-tool path-gate matrix

What "target path" each tool gates on:

| Tool | Target path | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `Read`, `Write`, `Edit` | the tool's `path` arg | The actual file being read/written. `Read("/B/x")` is checked against `/B`'s grant, not cwd. |
| `Bash` | each `/`-prefixed and `~/`-prefixed token in `cmd`; falls back to cwd if none | Covered above. |
| `Glob`, `Grep` | cwd | Inherently scoped — the walker descends from cwd; absolute paths in `globs[]` patterns don't actually escape because the walker is cwd-rooted. |
| `Task` | inherits parent's `path_modes` | Subagent runs with parent's grants snapshot at spawn. |
| `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` | cwd | Network ops, but tier-gated on cwd by current design (gate them through chat→read upgrade if you want them to require explicit approval). |
| `AskUser`, plan tools | cwd | Conversational primitives; cwd-tier check applies. |
| `Skill` | none — always allowed | Navigation primitive; the activated skill goes through its own permission flow. |
| `Memory_query`, `Memory_write` | cwd | Routes to a local HTTP daemon; gated by cwd's tier (Read for query, Edit for write per capability registry). |
| `capture_screenshot` | cwd | Network op (URL → image), cwd-tier check applies. |

## Path grants

A grant is `(path, mode)`. The grant covers the path and all children. Each session stores grants in `permission.json`:

```json
{
  "path_modes": [
    { "path": "~/workspace/linggen", "mode": "edit" }
  ]
}
```

That is the entire permission state. No config rules, no session ask-overrides, no denied-call list.

### Effective mode lookup

For the current working folder (or any tool target path):

1. Find the most-specific grant in `path_modes[]` whose `path` is an ancestor of (or equal to) the target. Use that mode.
2. No match → effective mode is **chat**.

That is the entire algorithm. No zones, no `/tmp` special case, no sensitive-path carveouts — every path is treated identically, defaulting to `chat`.

### Session creation

A new user session is given one grant on its starting working folder using the configured default mode (`tool_permission_mode` in `linggen.toml`, default **read**). Anywhere else has no grant — mode is `chat` until upgraded.

### Directory changes

When the agent or user runs `cd`, the engine updates the session cwd, recomputes the effective mode from `path_modes[]`, and emits a mode-change event. The chat header badge updates immediately. The grant list itself does not change.

This contains permission to the granted folder. Edit on project A does not leak to project B; `cd /tmp` lands in `chat` until the user grants `edit` (or higher) there.

### Mode upgrades

When the agent needs a tier higher than the effective mode, interactive sessions prompt:

```
Agent wants to edit src/main.rs

  [Switch this folder to edit]   ← persists (current_cwd, edit) in path_modes
  [Allow once]                   ← one-time approval, no persistence
  [Deny]
```

"Switch this folder to {mode}" is the persistent, always-approve-on-this-path option. After switching, all actions within the new ceiling pass without prompting. This is the only persistence path: **only explicit user approvals, mission frontmatter, and skill frontmatter write to `path_modes[]`**. Allow-once never persists.

### Reads are gated, too

A `Read` of a file outside any grant triggers the same prompt:

```
Agent wants to read /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

  [Switch /etc/nginx to read]
  [Allow once]
  [Deny]
```

Treating reads like writes is required for consumer safety. A remote consumer with a grant on `~/work` cannot reach into `~/.ssh`, because no grant covers it. There is no exception for "reads are cheap."

### Mode in chat widget

The chat header shows the effective mode for the current working folder and updates after `cd`:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Session: "Fix auth bug"     [edit ▾]    │
│  ~/workspace/linggen                     │
```

Clicking the badge changes the grant for the current working folder only. It does not change grants for unrelated folders.

## Hardcoded deny floor

A short, curated list of commands is denied at the engine level regardless of mode. Admin mode does not bypass it; the user cannot extend or relax it via config; the floor is baked into the binary.

| Pattern | Why |
|:--------|:----|
| `sudo …` | Privilege escalation — never authorized for an agent |
| `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf /*` | Whole-disk wipe |
| `dd of=/dev/{disk,sd*,nvme*,hd*}` | Direct disk overwrite |
| `mkfs.*` | Filesystem creation on a device |
| `:(){:\|:&};:` | Classic forkbomb |
| `chown -R … /`, `chmod -R … /` | Root-tree ownership/mode bombs |

This is a defense-in-depth floor against the most common foot-guns. Everything else is gated by mode. Users who want stricter control keep the session in `read` mode.

## Permission layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Hardcoded deny floor            │  Engine-baked, cannot be overridden
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. Session permission.json         │  path_modes[] — the only persisted state
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

No `[permissions]` block in `linggen.toml`. No project-level `permissions.json`. One persistent source per session.

## Check flow

```
 1. Tool in agent's effective set?              NO → blocked
 2. Classify action tier (read / edit / admin)
 3. Resolve target path (cwd if tool has none)
 4. Hardcoded deny floor matches command?       YES → blocked, no override
 5. Most-specific (path, mode) grant for target:
      effective mode tier ≥ action tier         → allowed
      otherwise (or no grant)                   → prompt if interactive,
                                                  pause/fail if unattended
```

Tools without a path target (e.g., `WebSearch`) check the effective mode for the session's current cwd.

## Session creators

Three ways to create a session, each with different initial grants.

### User session

- One grant auto-added on the starting cwd at the configured default mode (`tool_permission_mode`, default `read`).
- User upgrades interactively as needed.
- This is the default.

### Mission session

- Grants come from the mission's `permission:` block (`mode` + `paths`). The mission's `cwd` also receives the mode.
- No prompts during scheduled execution. If a mission needs more than its grants allow, the run records a permission-needed failure/pause.
- Hardcoded deny floor still applies.
- Session promotion (user sends a message): grants are preserved; future permission-needed events become interactive prompts.

### Skill invocation (within a user session)

Skills don't create sessions — they run inside the current user session. Skills that need elevated permissions declare it in frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: sys-doctor
permission:
  mode: admin
  paths: ["/"]
  warning: "Sys Doctor runs diagnostic commands and may suggest cleanup."
---
```

When the user invokes the skill:

```
Skill "sys-doctor" requests:
  admin mode on /
  ⚠️ Sys Doctor runs diagnostic commands and may suggest cleanup.

  [Approve]              ← writes (/, admin) into session permission.json
  [Run in current mode]  ← skill runs with existing grants, may fail
  [Cancel]
```

Approved grants are added to the current session's `permission.json` and persist for the session. The user can revoke by changing the mode for that path.

Skills without a `permission` section run with whatever grants the session already has.

## Remote access

| Context | Path grants | Permission-needed behavior |
|:--------|:------------|:---------------------------|
| Local browser (owner) | User-controlled | Prompt |
| Remote same-user (owner) | User-controlled | Prompt |
| Remote different-user (guest) | Owner-set | Pause/fail; no guest prompt |
| Proxy consumer (browser) | Owner room config + consumer mode | Block/pause; no consumer prompt |

For proxy consumers, the room config (`allowed_tools`, `allowed_skills`) is the hard ceiling. The consumer's grants live within that ceiling. Consumers cannot upgrade or grant new paths — they have no UI for it, and no prompts ever surface in their session.

## Subagents

- Inherit the parent session's grants (a snapshot at spawn time).
- Can only tighten — cannot upgrade mode (no `AskUser`).
- If a subagent needs more permission, it returns permission-needed to the parent.

## Configuration

```toml
[agent]
tool_permission_mode = "read"    # Default mode for new user sessions
```

That is the only permission-related config. No `[permissions]` block. No deny/ask rule tables. The engine's hardcoded deny floor is fixed and not user-configurable.

## Future

- **Safety classifier**: model-based Bash classification for smarter auto-decisions.
- **OS sandbox**: Seatbelt (macOS) / bubblewrap (Linux) for defense-in-depth.
- **Hooks**: pre/post-tool-use hooks for programmatic permission decisions.
