# Skills

Skill is all you need.

Linggen-agent is like a OS of agent, skill is the interface. Comparing with mcp, tools, skill is extendable, self-explained, so we do skill first in linggen-agent. 

Dynamic extensions: format, discovery, triggers, and tool registration.

Skills are the "dynamic libraries" of linggen-agent — loaded at runtime, callable by any agent, no code changes needed. Everything that isn't a core built-in tool should be a skill.

- `agents.md`: how agents use skills.
- `product-spec.md`: skills-first design principle.

## Format

Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as entrypoint:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── template.md        # Template for model to fill in
├── examples/          # Example outputs
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py      # Script the model can execute
```

`SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions.

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `name` | Display name, becomes `/slash-command` |
| `description` | When to use (model reads this to decide) |
| `argument-hint` | Autocomplete hint (e.g. `[issue-number]`) |
| `disable-model-invocation` | `true` = only user can invoke |
| `user-invocable` | `false` = only model can invoke |
| `allowed-tools` | Tools permitted when skill is active |
| `model` | Model preference (`cloud`, `local`, or specific model ID) |
| `context` | `fork` = run in isolated subagent |
| `agent` | Subagent type when `context: fork` |
| `trigger` | Custom trigger prefix (e.g. `"!!"`, `"%%"`) |

## Discovery

Skills are discovered at startup and on file change (live reload).

**Discovery paths** (higher priority wins):

| Level | Path | Scope |
|:------|:-----|:------|
| Personal | `~/.linggen/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | All projects |
| Project | `.linggen/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | This project only |
| Compat | `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/` | Cross-tool compatibility |

Descriptions are loaded into agent context so the model knows what's available. Full content loads only when invoked.

## Invocation

Two ways to invoke a skill:

1. **User**: type `/skill-name [args]` in chat.
2. **Model**: model decides to invoke based on description match.

Control who can invoke:
- Default: both user and model.
- `disable-model-invocation: true`: user only.
- `user-invocable: false`: model only.

## Trigger symbols

Parsed from user input only (model output is not parsed):

- `/` — built-in commands + skill invocation.
- `@` — mentions, routed to skills for the named target.
- Custom triggers declared in frontmatter.

**Matching order**: system triggers → user-defined triggers → pass-through to model.

## Skill tools

Skills can define tool functions via `tool_defs` in their metadata. These register dynamically in the tool registry alongside built-in tools.

- Skill tools execute as subprocesses (`sh -c`) with template substitution (`{{param}}`).
- Schemas are generated dynamically from skill definitions.
- Same command validation as Bash tool.

**Implementation**: `engine/skill_tool.rs`, `engine/tool_registry.rs`

## Cross-tool compatibility

Skills written for Linggen work in Claude Code and Codex — same Agent Skills standard, same directory structure, same frontmatter.

The `linggen` skill (in `~/.claude/skills/linggen/`) lets other AI tools dispatch tasks to Linggen.
