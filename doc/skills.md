# Skills

Skill is all you need.

Linggen is like an OS of agents, skill is the interface. Compared with MCP and tools, skills are extendable and self-explained, so we do skills first in Linggen.

Dynamic extensions: format, discovery, triggers, and tool registration.

Skills are the "dynamic libraries" of Linggen — loaded at runtime, callable by any agent, no code changes needed. Everything that isn't a core built-in tool should be a skill.

Linggen skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard (spec: https://agentskills.io/specification). Skills are cross-compatible with Claude Code and Codex.

## Related docs

- `agents.md`: how agents use skills.
- `product-spec.md`: skills-first design principle.

## Format

Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as entrypoint. The directory name **must match** the `name` field in frontmatter.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── references/        # Detailed docs, loaded on demand
│   └── REFERENCE.md
├── scripts/           # Executable code the model can run
│   └── helper.py
└── assets/            # Static resources (templates, schemas)
```

`SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter + markdown body.

### Progressive disclosure

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): `name` + `description` loaded at startup for all skills.
2. **Instructions** (< 5000 tokens recommended): full `SKILL.md` body loaded on activation.
3. **Resources** (as needed): files in `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` loaded only when required.

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.

### Frontmatter fields

#### Agent Skills standard fields

These fields are defined by the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification) and work across Linggen, Claude Code, and Codex.

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|:------|:---------|:--------|
| `name` | yes | Lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars. Must match directory name. Becomes `/slash-command`. |
| `description` | yes | Max 1024 chars. What the skill does and when to use it. Model reads this to decide. |
| `license` | no | License name or reference to bundled file. |
| `compatibility` | no | Environment requirements (products, packages, network). |
| `metadata` | no | Arbitrary key-value pairs for extra info (author, version). |
| `allowed-tools` | no | Tools permitted when skill is active. |

#### Claude Code extension fields

These fields are defined by Claude Code and also supported by Linggen.

| Field | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `argument-hint` | Autocomplete hint (e.g. `[issue-number]`) |
| `disable-model-invocation` | `true` = only user can invoke |
| `user-invocable` | `false` = only model can invoke |
| `model` | Model preference (`cloud`, `local`, or specific model ID) |
| `context` | `fork` = run in isolated subagent |
| `agent` | Subagent type when `context: fork` |

#### Linggen extension fields

These fields are Linggen-specific extensions.

| Field | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `trigger` | Custom trigger prefix (e.g. `"!!"`, `"%%"`) |
| `app` | App config — makes the skill a directly-runnable app (see below) |

## App skills

Skills can act as **apps** — directly executable without model involvement. When a skill has an `app` section in frontmatter, invoking it (via `/skill-name` or clicking "Launch" in the UI) runs it immediately, bypassing the model entirely.

```yaml
---
name: arcade-game
description: Retro arcade games
app:
  launcher: web
  entry: scripts/index.html
  width: 800
  height: 600
---
```

### Launcher types

| Launcher | Behavior |
|:---------|:---------|
| `web` | Serve skill directory as static files, open in embedded panel (iframe) |
| `bash` | Execute `entry` script, stream output |
| `url` | Open external URL in browser or panel |

### App fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| `launcher` | yes | `web`, `bash`, or `url` |
| `entry` | yes | Filename (web/bash) or URL (url launcher) |
| `width` | no | Suggested panel width in pixels |
| `height` | no | Suggested panel height in pixels |

### Invocation

- **User**: `/skill-name` or click "Launch" button on the skill card in the Web UI.
- **Model**: call the `RunApp` built-in tool (see `tools.md`).

Both paths skip the model for the launch itself. The model can call `RunApp` during a conversation to open an app for the user.

### Static file serving

Web apps are served at `/apps/{skill-name}/`. The server resolves the skill's directory and serves files statically, scoped to the skill directory (no path traversal).

## Discovery

Skills are discovered at startup and on file change (live reload).

**Discovery paths** (higher priority wins):

| Level | Path | Scope |
|:------|:-----|:------|
| Personal | `~/.linggen/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | All projects |
| Project | `.linggen/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | This project only |
| Compat | `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/` | Cross-tool compatibility |

Descriptions are loaded into agent context so the model knows what's available. Full content loads only when invoked.

## Invocation

Two ways to invoke a skill:

1. **User**: type `/skill-name [args]` in chat.
2. **Model**: model decides to invoke based on description match.

Control who can invoke:
- Default: both user and model.
- `disable-model-invocation: true`: user only.
- `user-invocable: false`: model only.

## Trigger symbols

Parsed from user input only (model output is not parsed):

- `/` — built-in commands + skill invocation.
- `@` — mentions, routed to skills for the named target.
- Custom triggers declared in frontmatter.

**Matching order**: system triggers → user-defined triggers → pass-through to model.

## Skill tools

Skills can define tool functions via `tool_defs` in their metadata. These register dynamically in the tool registry alongside built-in tools.

- Skill tools execute as subprocesses (`sh -c`) with template substitution (`{{param}}`).
- Schemas are generated dynamically from skill definitions.
- Same command validation as Bash tool.

**Implementation**: `engine/skill_tool.rs`, `engine/tool_registry.rs`

## Cross-tool compatibility

Linggen follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Skills written for Linggen work in Claude Code and Codex — same directory structure, same frontmatter. Claude Code extension fields (`argument-hint`, `disable-model-invocation`, `context`, etc.) are also supported. Linggen-specific fields (`trigger`, `app`) are ignored by other tools.

Claude Code now treats `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/skills/` as equivalent — a command at `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` both create `/deploy`. Linggen supports both via compat discovery paths.

The `linggen` skill (in `~/.claude/skills/linggen/`) lets other AI tools dispatch tasks to Linggen.
