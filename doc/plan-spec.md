# Plan Spec

Redesign of the plan feature, aligned with Claude Code. Separates planning (read-only research) from execution, with user approval gates. Multi-model compatible.

## Related docs

- `agentic-loop.md`: kernel loop, termination.
- `tool-spec.md`: syscall interface, permissions.
- `chat-spec.md`: events, APIs.
- `storage-spec.md`: session message persistence.

## Design principles

1. **Enforce at infrastructure, not model level.** Remove tools from the API call — don't trust the model to not call them.
2. **Plans are free-form markdown, not structured JSON.** Any model can write text. No JSON parsing for plan creation.
3. **Progress tracking is separate from planning.** `update_plan` is for execution-time task tracking, decoupled from plan mode.
4. **Session-inlined persistence.** Plans are stored as JSON messages in the session's `messages.jsonl`. No separate plan files — the session is the single source of truth. Context compaction handles token cost; compaction is skipped during plan execution.
5. **Self-contained plans.** Plans must include file paths, line numbers, and code snippets so they work as the sole context after clearing.
6. **Unified flow.** No `PlanOrigin` enum — all plans use the same approval flow. Plan mode requires user initiation and approval.

## Changes from previous design

### Dropped

- `PlanOrigin` enum — single unified flow, no `ModelManaged` vs `UserRequested` distinction.
- Per-session plan persistence to separate files — now inlined in session `messages.jsonl`.
- Plan auto-resume (`load_latest_plan()`) — session resume replaces it.
- `plan_file_path` field — removed. No separate plan files.
- `generate_plan_filename()` — removed. No `~/.linggen/plans/` directory.
- Sidecar `.meta.json` files — removed.
- Stale `Planned` → `Executing` auto-promotion — no silent approval bypass.
- Bash in plan mode — blocked entirely for safety.
- Task blocked in plan mode — now allowed so the model can delegate research to subagents for complex tasks (keeps main context clean).

### Kept

- `PlanUpdate` events.
- `update_plan` action for execution-time progress (separate feature).
- `plan_mode: bool` on engine.
- Status lifecycle: `Planned` → `Approved` → `Executing` → `Completed`. Also `Planned` → `Rejected`.

### Added

- **`ExitPlanMode` tool** — model calls this when plan is ready, triggers approval.
- **Fallback detection** — if model emits `done` in plan mode without calling `ExitPlanMode`, treat as implicit exit.
- **Direct plan editing** — user can edit plan markdown before approving (Web UI: inline editor).
- **Approval UI** — inline: "Start building" / "Reject" / custom feedback. Web UI: approve endpoint with `clear_context` option.
- **Self-contained plan prompts** — plan-mode prompt emphasizes code snippets and line numbers.
- **Compaction guard** — context compaction is skipped when plan status is `Approved` or `Executing`, ensuring the model retains full tool-result context during plan execution.

## Lifecycle

### Entry

1. `/plan <task>` command in Web UI (user-initiated).
2. Model emits `enter_plan_mode` → engine enters plan mode directly and runs the plan dispatch loop.

### Research phase

Tools available: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `AskUser`, `ExitPlanMode`, `UpdatePlan`, `Task`.

Tools blocked (removed from API call): `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `lock_paths`, `unlock_paths`, `Skill`.

Model researches the codebase (directly or by delegating to a subagent via Task for complex tasks), then writes a self-contained markdown plan and calls `ExitPlanMode`. Delegation keeps the main agent's context clean — research results stay in the subagent's context, and only the analysis is returned.

### Approval

Inline approval (via AskUser bridge):
- **Start building** — approves the plan and begins execution.
- **Reject** — plan discarded.
- **Custom text** — user types feedback; model refines plan and re-submits.

Web UI approval (via `/api/plan/approve`):
- Passes `clear_context: bool` to choose whether to clear conversation history.
- Clear context → plan is sole context for execution. Keep context → full conversation retained.

### Execution

Plan text injected into system prompt. Model executes with full tools. Progress tracking via `update_plan` is optional and independent. Context compaction is skipped during execution to preserve tool-result context.

### Completion

Not yet implemented. Future: on `done`, mark remaining tracked items as `Skipped`, set plan status → `Completed`, emit event.

## Progress tracking

`update_plan` remains as an independent feature — not coupled to plan mode. Used during execution or spontaneously for complex tasks. Drives the sidebar task list UI. Both `plan_text` and `items` are optional — the model can update either or both.

## Storage

Plans are persisted as JSON messages in the session's `messages.jsonl`:

```json
{"type":"plan","plan":{"summary":"...","status":"planned","plan_text":"...","items":[...]}}
```

No separate plan files. The session is the single source of truth. On reload, the UI parses these messages and renders them as PlanBlock components via `tryRenderSpecialBlock`.

## Model compatibility

Fallback detection (`done` in plan mode → implicit `ExitPlanMode`) applies to all models unconditionally, so plan mode works regardless of model capability. Models with native tool calling use `ExitPlanMode` directly; models without it rely on the fallback path.

Future: `capability_tier` config field to fine-tune per-model behavior (e.g., disabling `UpdatePlan` for small models).
